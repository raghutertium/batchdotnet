Interview questions:(till now asked ) 
--------------------
Q) what is the use of executescalar?when it is used maximum?

answer : when the select statment is returning single value then we go for executescalar.mostly it will be helpful to return """"""""select count(*) from emp"""""""" like values.. i.e. when you want to use group functions, then executescalar is the best source. Execute scalar is an Single value single column.This is very light-weight and is perfect when all your query asks for is one item and moreever we are working in connected environment and they are part of it why to fire executereader statement and increase the load more ever performance wise also it effects more when to use : when database query returns a single value and this value cannot be defined as output parameter, because of T-SQL type limitation for variables. For example type image cannot be output parameter in MSSQL.

The most common example for ExecuteScalar is fetching a single image stored in the database and converting it to array of bytes. If you google it - most examples will demonstrate using of ExecuteReader to accomplish image handler, however ExecuteScalar will be more scalable and faster.

Finally u can also Use ExecuteScalar to return identity or Guid newID.

1. Finalize why it is used ....

answer : 

finalized is a overriden method that is called automatically by the .net framework when the last instance of program gets executed and after that garbage collector deallocates the memeory but dispose is an overloaded method which is called by developer explicitly for example 10,000 lines of code i have written in that 10,000 lines of code my out object is there and i want to come out then i will call dispose method .
Another thing is that when garbage collector cannot clean unmanged objects like com,etc then we use explicitly finalize method for deallocating resources .
2.Difference between dispose and application exit 

answer :

dispose we talked already it always refer to current class object but application.exit means whole application gets closed.

4. can i implement web service in windows application ,how can u implement web service in 
mobile device what u can do 

answer : yes u can implement check the code in interent u will easily get other wise in backupof1gb \GUI i have kept where  we both can options using wsdl tool and also using visual studio .net 
   
5. can i use out inside a function 

answer :  we cannot use out variable inside a function.
		 

6. can i use abstract class inside a interface?
solution :

Interface itself is a abstract class with public abstract methods all of which must be implemented in the inherited classes.so I u cannot write an abstract class inside an interface..

class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class.As C# doesnt support multiple inheritance so we are going for interfaces and using base class object i cant call sub class functions i am going for abstract classes .

funcctionality wise u want to go u will use interfaces and if common features u want to implement u go for abastract classes like imagine house is constructed and some part is left out for that u will use abstract class but u want to build your own house then u will go for interfaces .

Abstract classes are generally used when set of classes are closely related .

Interfaces are often used when classes are not related yet they may share common functionality, 

You should consider using interface when you design is complete in itself i.e. no further methods need to be added later on the interface as any newly added method in interface need to be implemented in all classes that implement that interface. On the other hand, if we need to add a new method to an abstract class, we can provide default implementation of that method in the abstract class and there is no need for existing implementing classes to be changed in that case. 

classes (abstract or otherwise) are "is a", while interfaces are "can do".

Interfaces describe a behaviour, rather than what the thing is.

    If you anticipate creating multiple versions of your component, create an abstract class. Abstract classes provide a simple and easy way to version your components. By updating the base class, all inheriting classes are automatically updated with the change. Interfaces, on the other hand, cannot be changed once created. If a new version of an interface is required, you must create a whole new interface.
    If the functionality you are creating will be useful across a wide range of disparate objects, use an interface. Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best suited for providing common functionality to unrelated classes.
    If you are designing small, concise bits of functionality, use interfaces. If you are designing large functional units, use an abstract class.
    If you want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of your component, use an abstract class. Abstract classes allow you to partially implement your class, whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members. 




extra )What’s the implicit name of the parameter that gets passed into the class’ set method?
answer :  Value, and it’s datatype depends on whatever variable we’re changing.

extra )When you inherit a protected class-level variable, who is it available to?
answer :  Classes in the same namespace.

extra )Are private class-level variables inherited?
answer: Yes, but they are not accessible, so looking at it you can honestly say that they are not inherited. But they are.

extra )Describe the accessibility modifier protected internal.
answer: It’s available to derived classes and classes within the same Assembly (and naturally from the base class it’s declared in)

extra)C# provides a default constructor for me. I write a constructor that takes a string as a parameter, but want to keep the no parameter one. How many constructors should I write? 
answer: Two. Once you write at least one constructor, C# cancels the freebie constructor, and now you have to write one yourself, even if there’s no implementation in it.


extra)What’s the top .NET class that everything is derived from?
answer:  System.Object.

extra)How’s method overriding different from overloading?
answer:  When overriding, you change the method behavior for a derived class. Overloading simply involves having a method with the same name within the class.

extra)What does the keyword virtual mean in the method definition? 
answer:The method can be over-ridden

extra)Can you declare the override method static while the original method is non-static?
answer:  No, you can’t, the signature of the virtual method must remain the same, only the keyword virtual is changed to keyword override.

extra)Can you override private virtual methods?
answer: No, moreover, you cannot access private methods in inherited classes, have to be protected in the base class to allow any sort of access.

extra)Can you prevent your class from being inherited and becoming a base class for some other classes? 
answer:Yes, that’s what keyword sealed in the class definition is for. The developer trying to derive from your class will get a message: cannot inherit from Sealed class WhateverBaseClassName. It’s the same concept as final class in Java.

extra)Can you allow class to be inherited, but prevent the method from being over-ridden? 
answer: Yes, just leave the class public and make the method sealed.


extra)Can you inherit multiple interfaces?
answer: Yes, why not.



extra)If a base class has a bunch of overloaded constructors, and an inherited class has another bunch of overloaded constructors, can you enforce a call from an inherited constructor to an arbitrary base constructor?
answer: Yes, just place a colon, and then keyword base (parameter list to invoke the appropriate constructor) in the overloaded constructor definition inside the inherited class.



extra)Is it namespace class or class namespace? 
answer: The .NET class library is organized into namespaces. Each namespace contains a functionally related group of classes so natural namespace comes first.
7. can i use select inside a insert statement ?
 answer : There are two methods used in this ...
 
 
 INSERT INTO SELECT:
 ===================
 This method is used when table is already created in the database earlier and data is to be inserted into this table from another table. If columns listed in insert clause and select clause are same, they are are not required to list them. I always list them for readability and scalability purpose.
USE AdventureWorks
GO
----Create TestTable
CREATE TABLE TestTable (FirstName VARCHAR(100), LastName VARCHAR(100))
----INSERT INTO TestTable using SELECT
INSERT INTO TestTable (FirstName, LastName)
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Contact
WHERE EmailPromotion = 2
----Verify that Data in TestTable
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM TestTable
----Clean Up Database
DROP TABLE TestTable
GO

so this is one method and now i will go with another method ..

Method 2 : SELECT INTO 
This method is used when table is not created earlier and needs to be created when data from one table is to be inserted into newly created table from another table. New table is created with same data types as selected columns.
USE AdventureWorks
GO
----Create new table and insert into table using SELECT INSERT
SELECT FirstName, LastName
INTO TestTable
FROM Person.Contact
WHERE EmailPromotion = 2
----Verify that Data in TestTable
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM TestTable
----Clean Up Database
DROP TABLE TestTable
GO


G:\TOTAL.TRAINING.ONLINE.MICROSOFT.SQL.SERVER.DEVELOPMENT-HELL\Lesson 11 MODIFYING DATA   (29 min)(Refer first video in this okay ) 
we use this kind of above programing when u are working with temperory tables and ETL kind of work u are doing means extract transform load etc then also u will use above king of select into and insert into okay .

8. can i use inside update statement groupby and agreggate function

answer:
yes u can use inside update statement group by and aggregate functions and can used with joins also easily ..

9. what is the difference between constant variable and read only variable and how can i can 
   edit the values of read only function
answer : 
read only variable values are assigned at run time where as constant values are assigned at 
compile time ,we can assign a value to read only variable at run time it is unassigned identifier but 
once we assign a value we cant change so it is nothing but what we are doing is sames setter and getter methods 
which we have return for it like that only and assignemnt to read only variable is possible in constructor 
only we cant write setter method for it .....







12. what is the other use of using like inside bracket { } how u can use it?

answer : 

string connString = "Data Source=localhost;Integrated " + 
  "Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=Northwind;";

using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString))
{
  SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
  cmd.CommandText = "SELECT ID, Name FROM Customers";
  
  conn.Open();

  using (SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
  {
    while (dr.Read())
    Console.WriteLine("{0}\t{1}", dr.GetString(0), dr.GetString(1));
  }
}

so i can write like this above code using using like this so wrting like this 


When you are using an object that encapsulates any resource, you have to make sure that when you are done with the object, the object's Dispose method is called. This can be done more easily using the using statement in C#. The using statement simplifies the code that you have to write to create and then finally clean up the object. The using statement obtains the resource specified, executes the statements and finally calls the Dispose method of the object to clean up the object. The following piece of code illustrates its use.

 
using (TextWriter w = File.CreateText("log.txt"))
{
    w.WriteLine("This is line one");
}

so now u better understand ...

another benifit of using is that using the using statement i can create an alias class which is same as earlier ..




13. At run time how can u change the value of a variable ?

answer : yes check it same folder backupof1gb \GUI and u can go for setter and getter methods also at run time .


14. connection pool?

answer:

Connection pooling is the ability of re-use your connection to the Database. This means if you enable Connection pooling in the connection object, actually you enable the re-use of the connection to more than one user.
The connection pooling is enabled by default in the connection object. If you disable the connection pooling, this means the connection object which you create will not be re-used to any other user than who create that object.

Connection pooling is process of taking a connection from a pool of connections, once connection is created in the pool any application can re-use that connection.

The main purpose of any application is provide fast & efficient solution, mainly the perform of the system/application depends on the database activity. Making a connection to the database is time consuming (which depends on network speed & memory) when pooling is true the request for database connection can be fulfilled from the pool instead of re-connecting to the database, which will increase database performance.

What if connection in the pool finishes?
 
Connections are released back in to the pool when you call close or dispose, when no connection available to serve the request will be queued & connection is available in the pool it will be serve to the request.
 
When you do not close connections properly in your application you will get following error:
 
Exception: System.InvalidOperationException


extra )How does object pooling and connection pooling differ?

answer:
In Object pooling, you can control the number of connections.

In connection pooling, you can control the maximum number reached.

When using connection pooling, if there is nothing in the pool, a connection is created since the creation is on the same thread.

In object pooling, the pool decides the creation of an object depending on whether the maximum is reached which in case if it is, the next available object is returned. However, this could increase the time complexity if the object is heavy.

15. inside any table taking two continous values from one column side 2 -2 values and add it in another 
    column say total using update statement. how will u do that ????
	
answer: 	
16. Have u implemented sessions in your project the concept of sessions ? How do u implement in your project the concept of sessions ?
answer : 
 A session is the duration of connectivity between a client and a server application.....Session Identifier is used to identify session. It has SessionID property. When a page is requested, browser sends a cookie with a session identifier
 
16.A) what are the different modes of session ?

answer : refer some files in d:\fortelephonic ..
Types of sessions:

InProc: The default way to use sessions. InProc is the fastest way to store and access sessions.
OutProc: 
i. State server: 15% slower than InProc. Session is serialized and stored in aspnet_state.exe process. Stateserver sessions can be stored on a separate machine too. 
ii. SQL Server: 25% slower than InProc. Used when data is to be serialized and stored in SQL Server database.


extra ) session state works on some browsers only why ?

answer : 
you should make sure your browsers support cookie. Rename the domain name and the server name, and use only alphanumeric characters. Browse to the server by using the Internet Protocol (IP) address rather than the domain/server name.

extra)why is that the session state is not available ?
answer : 
first, check your web.config, machine.config and your page directive to make sure you have enabled session state.  Also, please note that session state isn't available just everywhere, anytime.  It is available only after the HttpApplication.AcquireRequestState event is called.  For example, it is NOT available in the Application_OnAuthenticateRequest handler inside global.asax.  

Q: Why isn't Session_End fired? 
A: This is one of the most frequently asked question. 
1. Remember Session_End event is supported only in InProc mode.  
2. Session_End won't be fired if you close your browser. HTTP is a stateless protocol, and the server has no way to know if your browser has closed or not. 
3. Session_End will be fired only (i) after n minutes of inactivity (n = timeout value), or (ii) if someone calls Session.Abandon(). 
4. For case (i) (pt. 3), Session_End will be run by a background thread, which implies:
    a. Your code in Session_End is running using the worker process account. You may have permission problem if you're accessing resource such as database.
    b. If an error happens in Session_End, it will fail silently.
5. For case (ii), please note that in order for Session_End to be fired, your session state has to exist first.  That means you have to store some data in the session state and has completed at least one request.  
6. Again for case (ii), Session_End will be called only if the abandoned session is actually found. As a result, if you create and abandon a session inside the same request, because the session hasn't been saved and thus can't be found, Session_End won't be called.  This is a bug in v1 and upcoming v1.1. 

Q: What is the difference between Session.Abandon() and Session.Clear()? 
A:The major practical difference is that if you call Session.Abandon(), Session_End will be fired (for InProc mode), and in the next request, Session_Start will be fired. Session.Clear( ) just clears the session data without killing it. 

Q: Can I share session state between web applications (i.e. "virtual directories" or "applications" in IIS)? 
A: No.  Sorry.

Q: What kinds of object can I store in session state? 
A: It depends on which mode you are using: 
- If you are using InProc mode, objects stored in session state are actually live objects, and so you can store whatever object you have created. it does not work in web farm where we have some set of servers when we have large no of users we go for more servers to share the load .
- If you are using State Server or SQL Server mode, objects in the session state will be serialized and deserialized when a request is processed.  So make sure your objects are serializable and their classes must be marked as so.  If not, the session state will not be
saved successfully. state server is related to value coming from window service .

so session state is an object which lives in asp.net server per client .so if u are using session u need not have to pass and get back the data within the application okay .it remebers all the values of previous iterations done on the seesion and it will be stored at the centre and can be used by anypage from anyside but in querystring we have to pass both in first page and second page same the value again and again.scalebility problem comes when u are storing huge amount of data in sessions that is only drawback .

we can store objects also in session and we need not have to serilize as we are not moving it from client to server or like that .
we can also store collection of objects also in sessions means everytime when i am clicking a button value from a textbox is added into sessions in the form of list and finally i will bind that to bulleted list later on .

we can configure in web.config file as well like this ...as sessions is server side to increase performance i can reduce session state to less in web .config file 

<sessionState timeout="9"  mode ="Inproc"  cookieless="true "/>

mode property tells where the sesssions is stored it has the following values : custom,inproc,off,sqlserver ,stateserver .

Q) In which situation u can use cookies and querystring  ?

sol) suppose u have default page when ever u hit a website if u have not created cookies for the user it willl take u to loginpage and there based upon username ur cookie is stored in response object which will be refelected back so next time when u say go back to home page then it will jump to default and as already cookie is there it will not go to login page but it will go to orderpage.aspx like that we cann use and sometimes after browser closing also i want the cookie to be there means i will use expiry time then again it will not go to login page so u can check videos it is mentioned clearly and in querystring to avoid malacisous code what u can do is use if (username = null and lenth is empty ) make the page to jump to error page and from there provide a link to default page so user can type directly in url to jump to second page which is malacious task okay .



Q: I am using SQLServer mode.  Why aren't my sessions expiring? 
A: In SQLServer mode, session expiration is carried out by the SQL Agent using a registered job.  Make sure your SQL Agent is running. 



18. what is the default time period of session expiry in cookies ?

answer:20 minutes 

20 . have u used predicate class in visual c# ? what is a predicate delegates in c#?
answer : 

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/114931/Understanding-Predicate-Delegates-in-C

A predicate delegate is a delegate with the following signature:

    Return type - bool
    Argument type - generic

So, a predicate delegate is a delegate which points to a boolean function that returns true or false and takes a generic type as an argument. A predicate delegate thus is a delegate which is capable of taking any custom type as an argument.

==================

1. how to create custom controls in asp.net ?

answer : Note :  REFER THE FOLLOWING VIDEOS FOR PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF CONCEPT:

J:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\three\TASP2W2_P1\VIDEO\L03

so in usercontrol we can define properties ,events and methods as well but the drawback is that i cannot put a user control inside a toolbox and also we cannot see the events and properties in properties windows so it will be just like a normal web page so here we have defined a address user control in the first video and dragged it two times so i want now spearate heading for each user control so i defined property and used setter method where i can say billing address and shipping address by going to label control and sayig label.header property which ever we have defined okay .In the same manner i can define events as well and that events are called in another button and instead of writing logic again and again i can define a method to copy the values from one control to other and use it so once u go through video u will get total idea of using a user control completely like this .


J:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\three\TASP2W2_P1\VIDEO\L04

Note : generally the web controls render themselves as span tag to avoid that what it has to render and to tell what tag it is i have to create a  contructor and in base class u have use type of tag like A,input for anchor and textbox and later on common method of adding attributes to those tags so like this it goes and u will not use rendercontents method for textbox because there is nothing between opening tag and colosing tag but for href to click the hyperlink some text has to be mentioned so this method is required .

There are two ways of creating web server control one is through class library project and creating a dll of it where one class will inherit from control class and in reder method htmltextwriter class will be there using the object of it can pump html tags into the web page so i had defined a color hyperlink control so once created if u want to use it add reference of dll and use register tag on the top and with the prefix u can use that control as well okay .so above we have written simple writer.write method but this writer methods has some bunch of methods so i will use those methods as well to define each element of hyperlink control instead of writing it directly in double quotes okay which u can check from videos okay .so to add that dll into toolbox right click and say choose items and now no need to register and all every thing is done automatically .so for this control if u check the properties window it is dissappointing okay .so to get all those background ,foreground color ,text etc properties of a label we need to define properties in the class file okay .But it is very diffcult to write properties like that to a control all properties we cant define so .so microsoft recognized it and instead of inheriting from control it will inherit from web control library .

J:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\three\TASP2W2_P1\VIDEO\L05

so now in web control library  u will see the boiler code for it .so in this no need to add references of dll of web control it will have it which we have done for dll control okay .now we can chnage the class name as stylelinkedcontrol which will inherit automatically from webcontrol .only few properties will come automatically in this also if for an hyperlink control i want a url property i have to write it by taking text property which is already present along with its bindable properties so u can check videos it is little bit diffcult but can be done without any diffculty .


and still to go in deep u can refer some pdfs later on from vb.netwholedemos which u have done in bitbybit and also some folders which contain some pdfs which u downloaded a lot earlier also indepth but right now to answer in interview this much will be enough .


Note : u need some practise on these things then u will come into flow how to implement events and alll 

3. which is the parent or default class of button ?
answer :

System.Object 
  System.MarshalByRefObject
    System.ComponentModel.Component
      System.Windows.Forms.Control
        System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase

midquestsolutions and aryansolutions questions :
================================================
1)what is the three tier architecture of the project ?Explain and list out its advantages ?what is the difference between then n-tier and 3 tier applications ? explain ?

answer : This is a very popular c# interview question.In 3 tier architecture / layer we divide the project in to 3 layers UI , Middle  and DAL.  Due the modular approach we have 2 big advantages

Reusability :- You can reuse the middle layer with different user interfaces like ASP.NET , windows etc. You can also reuse you DAL with different projects.

Maintainability :-  When we change in one layer due to the modular approach it does not have ripple effect on other layers. we have to do less amount of changes in other layer when we change logic of one layer.

There is no difference. Some people refer to the N Tier Architecture where 'N' can be any number. I personally have found no use for any more than 3 tiers, which is why I always call it the 3 Tier Architecture. If you try to build an application with more than three layers then be aware that it may have a serious impact on performance, as discussed in

8)what is managed code and unmanaged code in C#?

answer : what ever code which we write according to rules of .net framework is called as managed code 
suppose sql server 2005 is integreted with .net framework so i can write managed triggers and functions 
like that so code that is executed by CLR is managed code before .net framework came what and code u have written is unmanaged code and what u are writing is managed code Visual Basic 6, Visual C++ 6 all are unmanaged code 
What Is Managed Code?
Managed Code is what Visual Basic .NET and C# compilers create. It compiles to Intermediate Language (IL), not to machine code that could run directly on your computer. The IL is kept in a file called an assembly, along with metadata that describes the classes, methods, and attributes (such as security requirements) of the code you've created. This assembly is the one-stop-shopping unit of deployment in the .NET world. You copy it to another server to deploy the assembly there—and often that copying is the only step required in the deployment.

Managed code runs in the Common Language Runtime. The runtime offers a wide variety of services to your running code. In the usual course of events, it first loads and verifies the assembly to make sure the IL is okay. Then, just in time, as methods are called, the runtime arranges for them to be compiled to machine code suitable for the machine the assembly is running on, and caches this machine code to be used the next time the method is called. (This is called Just In Time, or JIT compiling, or often just Jitting.)

As the assembly runs, the runtime continues to provide services such as security, memory management, threading, and the like. The application is managed by the runtime.

Visual Basic .NET and C# can produce only managed code. If you're working with those applications, you are making managed code. Visual C++ .NET can produce managed code if you like: When you create a project, select one of the application types whose name starts with .Managed., such as .Managed C++ application..

What Is Unmanaged Code?
Unmanaged code is what you use to make before Visual Studio .NET 2002 was released. Visual Basic 6, Visual C++ 6, heck, even that 15-year old C compiler you may still have kicking around on your hard drive all produced unmanaged code. It compiled directly to machine code that ran on the machine where you compiled it—and on other machines as long as they had the same chip, or nearly the same. It didn't get services such as security or memory management from an invisible runtime; it got them from the operating system. And importantly, it got them from the operating system explicitly, by asking for them, usually by calling an API provided in the Windows SDK. More recent unmanaged applications got operating system services through COM calls.

Unlike the other Microsoft languages in Visual Studio, Visual C++ can create unmanaged applications. When you create a project and select an application type whose name starts with MFC, ATL, or Win32, you're creating an unmanaged application.

This can lead to some confusion: When you create a .Managed C++ application., the build product is an assembly of IL with an .exe extension. When you create an MFC application, the build product is a Windows executable file of native code, also with an .exe extension. The internal layout of the two files is utterly different. You can use the Intermediate Language Disassembler, ildasm, to look inside an assembly and see the metadata and IL. Try pointing ildasm at an unmanaged exe and you'll be told it has no valid CLR (Common Language Runtime) header and can't be disassembled—Same extension, completely different files.

What about Native Code?
The phrase native code is used in two contexts. Many people use it as a synonym for unmanaged code: code built with an older tool, or deliberately chosen in Visual C++, that does not run in the runtime, but instead runs natively on the machine. This might be a complete application, or it might be a COM component or DLL that is being called from managed code using COM Interop or PInvoke, two powerful tools that make sure you can use your old code when you move to the new world. I prefer to say .unmanaged code. for this meaning, because it emphasizes that the code does not get the services of the runtime. For example, Code Access Security in managed code prevents code loaded from another server from performing certain destructive actions. If your application calls out to unmanaged code loaded from another server, you won't get that protection.

The other use of the phrase native code is to describe the output of the JIT compiler, the machine code that actually runs in the runtime. It's managed, but it's not IL, it's machine code. As a result, don't just assume that native = unmanaged. 


Q)what is marhsalling and unmarshalling of data ?
Note :In few words, "marshalling" refers to the process of converting the data or the objects into a byte-stream, and "unmarshalling" is the reverse process of converting the byte-stream beack to their original data or object. The conversion is achieved through "serialization".




syscon question :

answer )  odbcad32.exe file is used 


value adds questions:
======================

1. how will you change the versioning of file in GAC if i am having two files with the same name?

answer : rebuild the website referencing the new version number, put the new version in the /bin directory, then that DLL will be used.while deploying the project only we can do that ..or

GAC is a very special folder, normally you would not be 
able to place two files with the same name into a Windows 
folder, GAC differentiates by version number as well, so 
it?s possible for MyApp.dll and MyApp.dll to co-exist in 
GAC if the first one is version 1.0.0.0 and the second one 
is 1.1.0.0.

refer for extra knowledge some topics in this :
G:\CBT Nuggets Exam-Pack 70-536 .NET 2.0 Application Development Foundation\files\videos\n550

Note : i had created an assembly and i want to know about that the runtime features of that assembly then i will use reflection class for it i can create an function and a assembly object i can create and using a. i can extract all the information so this is one way of using reflection classes in .net

answer: first store the xml file in  a local variable which is also of xml type and then apply ur logic u can go for 
open xml file and parse the document or u can directly use xquery to retrive ur wanted values and attributes of xml file ...and we have got many readxml and write xml file methods also we can go for it .

5. can a function return tables?

answer ) yes we have seen inline lable and table valued functions which we will cover in portion also 

6. what is difference between clone and copy in asp.net ?

answer ) Clone will copy the structure of a data where as
Copy will copy the complete structure as well as data .
Using Dataset.clone() creates new instance of the same object.
Using Dataset.copy() copies content of data to another object wihtout creating new instance.
 
DataTable dt=new DataTable();
dt=ds.Tables[0].copy(); will copy all the data and structure to dt table

dt=ds.Table[0].clone(); will create only the structure of table not data.

extra) What is the main difference between Response.Write() and Response.Output.Write()?
answer ) 
With Response.Outout.Write options are available to you to write the formatted out put. 

extra)What data types do the RangeValidator control support?

answer ) Integer, String, and Date.

extra)What is the difference between a class and struct ?
answer ) 
A struct is a value type while a class is a reference type. There’s no inheritance with 
struct.


extra)When passing a variable by reference to a method what is the difference between keywords ref and out?
answer ) 

When using the key word ref the variable must be initialize before calling the method, 
while initialization is not mandatory when using out.

11.What part of the code is called Inline Code?
answer ) 

The asp .net client side code is usually call inline code. From most browsers it can be 
view by choosing 'View source' from the page menu.

12.What is the difference between doing a Dataset.Clone() and Dataset.Copy()?
answer ) 
Dataset.Clone() will copy just the dataset structure including all the datatables, 
schemas, relations and constraints; it will not copy the data. Dataset.Copy() will copy 
both dataset structure and data.

13.What is the role of  Global.asax file?
answer ) 

The Global.asax include its code behind file Global.asax.cs, it is use to implement 
application and session level events.

17.What property is use to set alternate color scheme in a Repeater control?
answer) 
AlternatingItemTemplate.

18.What is the base class for Web Forms?
The System.Web.UI.Page class.

19.What are the meaning of terms boxing and un-boxing?
Boxing: Implicit conversion of a value type into a reference type.
Un-Boxing: Explicit conversion of a reference type into a value type. Can also be call 
casting.

20.Give a brief description of how the heap and stack are managed in .Net.
Stack and heap are memory sections of the .net application. The CLR(Common Language Runtime) is in charge of managing those sections.
Value type variables are stored in the stack where storing order is Last in first out. 
When a variable is out of scope it basically fall off the stack.
Refence type variable are stored on the heap where storing order is First in first out. 
When a variable becomes out of scope it is mark for collection.
The GC(Garbage Collector) is the part of the CLR responsible for cleaning up the heap releasing resources occupied by Reference type variables.

extra questions on C# only :
============================

Q) can multiple data types can be stored in System.array ?

answer: Yes if we declared data type as an object then each element refer each data type 

Q)what is generics in C#?

answer : check deccansoft video in J :\ means external hard disk okay .
Q) how to put read only in C#?

answer : An property is entity that describes the features of object .The key difference in field and property is inclusion of interace .We make use of get and set keywords while working with properties .

Q)what is the use of system.environment class ?

answer : when u want to retrive the information about the operating system we use this class 
some of its static memebers of the class are as follows ...

Environment.OSVersion --gets the version of operating system.
Environment.Machinename ---gets the name of current machine
Enviornment.Username ---gives the name of the entity that invoked the system

Q) why does compiler throw an error when variables are declared with intial values ?

answer : The variable will not recieve default value when they are in some scope .so what i am telling is 
that compiler throws an error when variables are declared without an intial value and when the decleration is with in memeber scope and also remeber when variable is used as an output variable no need to intilaze it ...



Q) what are the default values of bool,int,char,string,double,reference type ?

answer : bool --false 

         int --0
		 
		 double --0
		 
		 string ---null
		 
		 char ---'\0'
		 
		 Reference type --null
		 
		 
		 
Q) how to find whether a class implements at runtime ?

answer : u can go for explicit cast ,or as keyword or is keyword in program to know this ...
G:\CBT Nuggets Microsoft Programming NET 4 Software Development Fundamentals 98-361 (refer 7th video for this ) 

so imagine u have a person class with some set and get properties defined for it and now u have defined a new class employee and that class is inherting person class and that class is having its own properties and u have written an function in which person object is going so due to encapsulation using person class u cannot call the properties of employee class so what u will do is like this 

private void LoadPersonListviewItem ( person p)

{
employee e = p as employee 
}

so lie this u can use it is clearly mention in the video refer it from half of it .
in the same manner we can use is also if (p is character? "character","employee "  like this we can use check the video so this is the way u can use it .

Q) how to call COM component in .net ? what is interoperability ?

answer : COM components and .net components have different architectures ,for both of them to communicate with each other interoperation feature is required ,this feature is called as Interoperability .Net componenets communicate 

with COMS using RCW class (Runntime cllable wrapper) 

right click ---> add references-->select com tabl-->select com componenet 


if u want to use directly in your program include system.runtime.interopservices ......


for reverse operation go com callable wrapper ccl....means including .net component in com technology ...

Q) can a garbage collector controls the activity of the thread ?

answer : yes we can by setting the property in application.config file and In system.GC there is a method call collect which forces garbage collector to collect all unrefernced objects immedeately there by giving developer some 
control over garbage collector .so indirectly i am saying that i can call garbage collector explicitly ...

extra questions from chennai :
===============================

1. can we instatantiate the object of sealed class ?
ans) yes 

3. tell me types of serlization in ?how many types are there ?
answer : binary,soap and xml etc like that he told
4. how to retrive single row value when stored procedure is returning many values ?

answer : use scalar 


6. which class of xml is used to do xsl transformation?

answer : xsltransform

7. Can i use reader class to fill into dataset ?
answer : no 


8. what is the use of JIT ?
answer )

A Microsoft.NET application can be run only after the MSIL code is translated into native machine code. In .NET Framework, the intermediate language is complied "just in time" (JIT) into native code when the application or component is run instead of compiling the application at development time. The Microsoft.NET runtime consists of two JIT compilers. They are standard JIT compiler and the EconoJIT compiler. The EconoJIT compiler compiles faster than the standard JIT compiler, but the code it produces is not as optimized as the code obtained from the standard JIT compiler.


9. I have created one web service in .net i want to execute it in java ?
answer : 
yes of course web service are independent of languages it depends on WSDL and SOAP 
so anyone can develop the web service and disclose the wsdl file and users can consume that web service 
both wsdl and soap are xml based and there seriliaztion of data takes place means saving the state of object permenantly is callled serilization once serilized i can  transfer the data and it is treated as object only and all languages have xml parsing capabilities and access to http protocol are able to work with the web service okay 




10. why i am going for soap why not other protocols ?

answer ) Because it safe and more secure as serilization happens for data transfer okay 
11. 

FIS written and technical round questions :
============================================


1. what is the use of sql profiler in sql server 2005 ?

answer : This is mainly used for auditing of a table by database administrators okay 
it shows only which user has created and deleted the table .



2. what is the use of " with recompile option" in stored procedure ?

answer ) I have written a stored procedure which has an order by option in the select statment then based on a particular column the order is changing then i will go for with recompile option and it has another option like with encryption and we can use both at a time but with the function we have option encryption and schema binding as functions result is based on underlying tables in database .

5. how will u retrive the values from stored procedure using sql server 2005 which is returning 1000 rows 

   but u want to retrive paging wise means 50 50 50 like that is there any functionality in sql server to do that 

   check in indexing a hint was given ?

   sol) 
   
   The TABLESAMPLE clause limits the number of rows returned from a table in the FROM clause to a sample number or PERCENT of rows. For example:
   
   The Person.Person table contains 19,972 rows. The following statement returns approximately 10 percent of the rows. The number of rows returned usually changes every time that the statement is executed.

USE AdventureWorks2008R2 ;
GO
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person 
TABLESAMPLE (10 PERCENT) ;

B. Selecting a percentage of rows with a seed value

The following statement returns the same set of rows every time that it is executed. The seed value of 205 was chosen arbitrarily.

USE AdventureWorks2008R2 ;
GO
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person 
TABLESAMPLE (10 PERCENT) 
   REPEATABLE (205) ;

C. Selecting a number of rows

The following statement returns approximately 100 rows. The actual number of rows that are returned can vary significantly. If you specify a small number, such as 5, you might not receive results in the sample.

USE AdventureWorks2008R2 ;
GO
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person 
TABLESAMPLE (100 ROWS) ;


6. C# supports multiple inherience or not ?if not why ?

sol) In order to avoid ambuiguity problem .    The diamond problem is an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If a method in D calls a method defined in A (and does not override the method), and B and C have overridden that method differently, then from which class does it inherit: B, or C?

http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/csharpgeneral/thread/616d520b-ffae-4b3f-9e0c-35c47ce6ccc9

so why multiple interface inheritance will not cause this problem?

because in interface inhertitance you inherit decleration not implementaion



7. what is the difference between agregation and  inheritance ?
answer : Inheritance: extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclass.Aggregation: create new functionality by taking other classes and combining them into a new class. Attach an common interface to this new class for interoperability with other code.
Association
This is the simplest relationship between objects. Example 
every customer has sales. So
Customer object and sales object have an association 
relation between them.

Aggregation
This is also called as composition model. Example in order 
to make a “Accounts” class it
has use other objects example “Voucher”, “Journal” 
and “Cash” objects. So accounts
class is aggregation of these three objects.

G:\Lynda.com - Foundations of Programming. Object-Oriented Design\06. Inheritance and Composition (last video is enough) 
G:\UML\1. Introduction(3rd and 4th video ) 

extra) what is the use of application domain?

answer ) The primary use of this is to seperate an application from other applications .The win32 processes provide isolation by having distinct memeory address spaces but this expensive and doest scale well .Marshalbyobject is base class for objects that communicate across application domain boundaries 
by exchanging messages by proxy 

IMPortant : I have created an assembly i want to use it in more than one application then i deploy in GAC

9. delegates and multicast delegates ? will delegate return any value ?
answer )delegates will retun events means when event is fired it will call a delegate and that 
delgate will call the function 

10. what are generics ? why we have to use them ?
answer ) later disscussed 

11.without using crystal reports i want to generate reports using xml?

19. how many triggers we can implement on a table ?
sol)Effectively unlimited, although you can only have 1 INSTEAD OF INSERT, 1 INSTEAD OF UPDATE and 1 INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger

extra) If a table has 5 Insert triggers, which trigger will execute first.

You can use the stored procedure sp_settriggerorder to define the trigger that fires FIRST and/or LAST... the rest will fire in an undefined sequence.

If you are looking to have that many triggers, and the sequence is important, I would seriously consider combining them into a single trigger.

The "triggers are evil" brigade will probably suggest you move the logic elsewhere, and do away with the triggers entirely.

n SQL Server 6.5 you could define only 3 triggers per table, one for INSERT, one for UPDATE and one for DELETE. From SQL Server 7.0 onwards, this restriction is gone, and you could create multiple triggers per each action. But in 7.0 there's no way to control the order in which the triggers fire. In SQL Server 2000 you could specify which trigger fires first or fires last using sp_settriggerorder

Triggers can't be invoked on demand. They get triggered only when an associated action (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) happens on the table on which they are defined.

Triggers are generally used to implement business rules, auditing. Triggers can also be used to extend the referential integrity checks, but wherever possible, use constraints for this purpose, instead of triggers, as constraints are much faster.

G:\TOTAL.TRAINING.ONLINE.MICROSOFT.SQL.SERVER.DEVELOPMENT-HELL\Lesson 13 TRIGGERS & AUDIT TRAILS   (31 min)

Note : we can use only one instead of insert,update or delete trigger per table okay but for ,after kind of triggers u can have many okay .
       nested triggers is server level so we have to enable it first and recursive trigger is database level we have to say on or off for this .

is: The is operator is used to check whether the run-time type of an object is compatible with a given type
The is keyword checks whether the value on its left side is an instance of the type on the right side. For example:

if(obj is string)
{
     ...
}
as: The as operator is used to perform conversions between compatible types.

Some More Questions in .Net after leaving the job in  bbyb :
============================================================


1.   what is a GAC ?Explain it clearly ?

answer : The GAC or the Global Assembly Cache in .NET Framework acts as the central place for registering assemblies.All running applications that constitute development environments such as Web Matrtix, Visual Studio.NET, etc., can all use the registered assemblies. Each computer where the common language runtime (CLR) is installed has a global assembly cache.The .NET Framework provides two tools for working with the cache. One is a Windows shell extension that allows you to work with the cache using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The other is a command line tool, called the Global Assembly Cache tool (Gacutil.exe), that is typically used in build and test scripts.


2.   What are the stages in ASp.Net page life cycle ?
answer :G:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\one\TASP2W1_P1\VIDEO\L03 (refer only 6 7 and 8 videos that will be enough for this question )
and refer below links from interent for better understanding of concepts where to use which events and all as i dont have any thing stuff from other sites except the total training one okay .

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/73728/ASP-NET-Application-and-Page-Life-Cycle


 
so first a page object created and as we have declared some controls with run at server like label and all so first static intilaization happens means what and all i have kept at mark up those will be intilaized before page load event is fired .so the best place for static intilaization which u want to do it is in the mark up page .put a break point at page load and say add watch and mention name of labels u can see it has already got intialized .so after page load event no intilazation happens that concludes the end of intialization events so at this stage the state of all controls in view state is stored in view state.During the first visit to web page event handlers will not be fired .now asp.net asks each control in the page to render itself as html .

when u click the button second stage of intilazation happens view state is deserilized and updated with new values along with static intilization okay so again before page load if we check input text box and listbox the value has got added .and then as usual page load and then event handlers like button click event is fired.

so there are some methods present like init method and this is called after the page object is created and before asp page updates the controls with view state .so what is the use of this init method generally we cant access the controls value or use it before viewstate is not updated yet so what is the use of it it is used for programatic intilization of instance variables suppose some private instance variables of class  are there those we can intilaize that  in this method .so after all event handlers are fired asp.net asks the page to render itself and at that time we can overrirde like init method some prerender events as well so this is last stage to change the state of the object before rendering so use of this method is removing predifined textbox values which users have enetered and finally onunload method is called where we can release the resources .


 
3.   What is the use of prerender event in .net ?
answer : Before u want ur controls to see on page u want some change to be done that is possible using prerender event generally custom controls are created in prerender event .



4.   Can i see the manifest file ?
answer : 
An assembly is the primary building block of a .NET application and can take the form of a dynamic link library (DLL) or executable file (EXE). An assembly is a collection of functionality that is built, versioned, and deployed as a single implementation unit.

A .NET assembly may contain the following elements:

Assembly Manifest – Metadata that describes the assembly and its contents (see below)
Source Code – Compiled into Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL)
Type Metadata – Defines all types, their properties and methods, and most importantly, public types exported from this assembly
Resources – Icons, images, text strings and other resources

The assembly manifest is required; the other elements are optional.

An assembly manifest is metadata inside an assembly that describes everything there is to know about the assembly and its contents. The manifest contains:

Strong Name – The assembly's name, version, culture, optional processor architecture, and public key (for shared assemblies)
File Contents – Name and hash of all files in the assembly
Type List - Types defined in the assembly, including public types that are exported from the assembly
Resource List – Icons, images, text strings and other resources contained in the assembly
Dependencies – Compile-time dependencies on other assemblies
Security – Permissions required for the assembly to run properly

G:\CBT Nuggets Exam-Pack 70-536 .NET 2.0 Application Development Foundation\files\videos\n550(refer 13th video on asemblies) 

5.   what are types of assemblies and differences between them ?
answer : A private assembly is normally used by a single application and is stored in the application's directory. A shared assembly is normally stored in the global assembly cache which is a repository of assemblies maintained by the .NET runtime. Satellite assemblies are often used to deploy language-specific resources for an application. These language-specific assemblies work in side-by-side execution because the application has a separate product ID for each language and installs satellite assemblies in a language-specific subdirectory for each language.

satellite assembly contain only resources and no code ,the resources are location specific and a satillite assembly is associated with the main assembly the one that 
actually contains the code .

12.  Difference between union and union all in sql server 2005 ?
answer : The difference between Union and Union all is that Union all will not eliminate duplicate rows, instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table.

13.  Exact use of instead of trigger in sql server 2005 ?
answer : This is mainly used for updating a view as view may contain values from multiple tables so we cannot update a view directly so we can use instead of trigger at that moment ..
Imagine i have created a view from a single table only but no primary key included and if enter anything in that view the primary key value on the original table has also to be updated which will not happen so i will create an instead of trigger on main table and when i insert in view then we can insert easily on the other table of main so it is like that the use of instead of trigger so u can check a video on this on triggers it is given .In the instead of trigger  i will create a new guid like variable which will generate a primary key for the table instead of getting inserted into the main table so it is like this .

22.  Difference between .Net remoting and web service in .net ?
answer : when we want to do interprocess communication we go for .net remoting The applications can be located on the same computer, different computers on the same network, or even computers across separate networks.Web services are stateless and know nothing about the client that is making the request. The clients communicate by transferring messages back and forth in a specific format known as the Simple Object Access Protocol, or SOAP.but in net remoting it depends on tcp ip protocol ...

·	ASP.NET based Web services can only be accessed over HTTP. .NET Remoting can be used across any protocol.
.	Web services support interoperability across platforms and are good for heterogeneous environments. .NET Remoting requires the clients be built using .NET, or another framework that supports .NET Remoting, which means a homogeneous environment. 



23.  what is the difference between assembly and a namespace ?

answer : Namespaces are logical, whereas assemblies are physical.
A namespace is a logical naming scheme to group related types. Namespaces can contain other namespaces to form a hierarchy. The "fully qualified name" of a type is its namespace followed by its type name, separated by a period (for example, System.Windows.Forms.Button). Type names must be unique within a namespace, but the same type name can be used in different namespaces.
An assembly is a physical deployment scheme to group related types. An assembly can contain one or many namespaces. A namespace can exist in one or many assemblies.


25 . Explain exactly what haapens in web service ?Internal explanation of the web service ? Using xml like that things ?
answer)Web services enable a distributed environment in which any number of application or applications components can interoperate seamlessly among and between organizations in a platform neutral, language neutral fashion. A web service is a piece of business logic located somewhere on the internet and is accessible through standard based protocols such as HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).The web services are xml based, loosely coupled, coarse grained, synchronous or asynchronous and the document exchange using XML.The SOAP protocol provides packaging for transporting XML documents over a variety of standard internet technologies such as SMTP, HTTP and FTP. The we service can be described with the help of an XML document called as WSDL (Web services description language). WSDL describes the interface of a web service in a standardised way. All the web services need to be published in the UDDI (Universal Description Discovery and Integration). It is a registry of web services for advertisement, discovery and integration purposes.A web service must be simple and discrete such as an international currency conversion service. It may be a whole service of applications representing an entire business function such as an auto insurance claims processor. A web service can access and encapsulate other web services to perform its function.

3. what is non functional requirement in software engineering ?

sol)functional requirement --- A system/software requirement that
specifies a function that a system/software system or system/software
component must be capable of performing. These are software requirements
that define behavior of the system, that is, the fundamental process or
transformation that software and hardware components of the system
perform on inputs to produce outputs.

nonfunctional requirement  --- in software system engineering,
a software requirement that describes not what the software will do,
but how the software will do it, for example, software performance
requirements, software external interface requirements,
software design constraints, and software quality attributes.
Nonfunctional requirements are difficult to test;
therefore, they are usually evaluated subjectively.

========================

1. suppose I  am having two master pages in asp.net and i want to apply my one of that master page to my application for that i have to apply it from client side how will i give a client a option to choose any of the master page instead of doing it at compile time .

answer : Master page will have one property called .Masterfile like and u have to write the code in preinit method to tell which master page u are pointing to okay .

2. what is the difference between typed and untyped dataset 
answer ) Typed dataset has its own schema and when we say ds.tables normally but in typed one we write schema provided by company that is what we call typed dataset or when i create a dataset and give some name graphically in devloping or writing logic for business layer i include some methods in that for object data source so at that i will make use of typed dataset.

3. why does page losses its values while transferring to another page what is the function of view state 
   in asp.net ?
 sol) The page loses it value because it works on stateless porotocol .
4. what is the difference between server.transfer and response. redirect methods ?
answer ) 
Server.Transfer transfers page processing from one page directly to the next page without making a round-trip back to the client's browser.  This provides a faster response with a little less overhead on the server.  Server.Transfer does not update the clients url history list or current url.  Response.Redirect is used to redirect the user's browser to another page or site.  This performs a trip back to the client where the client's browser is redirected to the new page.  The user's browser history list is updated to reflect the new address.
Server.Transfer() send the request to server
Response.Redirect() sends the request to Browser
So If the Request is made for the location outside the Server it fails. so you need to use Respons.Redirect().

Server.Transfer is used when redirecting the webpage with in the same application whereas Response.Redirect is applicable towards the redirection of webpage between 2 applications 
Resonse.redirect can be used both for aspx and html pages.But server.transfer is only used for aspx pages it will not work for html pages.

NIIT Technologies questions asked in final 3rd round 
====================================================

1. Can i use having clause along with where clause and also check how to use compute by check that also for information sake ?
sol) 
sometimes I want some set of related things to group together.I want to show them on one side, one after the other .

imagine this is the table i am using 
select Title ,VacationHours from HumanResources.Employee

sometimes u want data matching specific crieria to be displayed together in resultset

select Title from  HumanResources.Employee group by Title 
here it is showing the output in ascending order....

select Title ,sum(VacationHours)  from HumanResources.Employee group by Title 
so this will work but if i remove sum then it will not work so any column which is not included in group by clause must have aggregate functions eventhough u are not using that column in where clause okay that is the funda 
so this again tells us that if i say select * from HumanResources.Employee group  by Title will not work .so i think now idea is clear for u .
select Title,VacationHours  from HumanResources.Employee 
 where ( VacationHours >20 ) group by Title
//this will not get executed ...above one because whenever we are using 
//where clause it should have aggregate 
//functions...used before it..
//if u are not using where then u can use can use group by 

select * from HumanResources.Employee
select Title,minimum=min(VacationHours),
Maximum=max(VacationHours) from HumanResources.Employee 
where VacationHours>20 group by Title


so we come to conclusion that single handedly
we can write aggregate functions to column
we can write groupby functions to columns
BUT BUT when I am using both group by and where class then
the column in where class should have have aggregate function associated with it.

now what  is the use of having clause just  as we use 
select in combination with where clause

we use having in combination with group by after 
getting the groups we eleminate them that
match the condition means we elemeinate the whole group

select Title,minimum=min(VacationHours),Maximum=max(VacationHours)
 from HumanResources.Employee where 
VacationHours>20 group by Title

select Title,minimum=min(VacationHours),Maximum=max(VacationHours) from HumanResources.Employee where 
VacationHours>20 group by Title having avg(VacationHours)>55

//you can run the two queries and check how the e's ' related set of group is eleminated because its
// having very less average if we change the thing 35 to 55 still more groups not satifying the condition
//are removed from the list...


the same group by clause can be applied to not only single columns but to many columns when we want to
apply it all columns then we go for ALL keyword...

see the demo here

select Title,'EmployeeID'=EmployeeID ,minimum=min(VacationHours),Maximum=max(VacationHours) 
from Humanresources.Employee where VacationHours>20 group by Title ,EmployeeID
//make a note for whom and all u are not applying aggregate functions... functions for them u have to 
//put thme under group by as above because if i am not includeing employeeId in group by it is showing error..
//second thng is that on all the columns on which we are doing the aggregate functions must be 
//kept under where clause...so now we will try out for all keyword...

//for the above theory just written if I am trying for simple query also
//it is not executing

select Title,VacationHours from HumanResources.Employee group by Title 

 but same thing gets executed when i use aggregate or include that column in group by

select Title,avg (VacationHours) from HumanResources.Employee group by Title 


so everything is trial and error checking


The ALL keyword of the Group by clause is used to display all groups including those which are excluded by the where clause so the ALL keyword is meaningful to those queries that contains where clause so if ALL is not used group by clause does not show the groups for which there are no matching rows .However group by all shows all rows even groups having no rows meet the search conditions .

The following below query retrives the records for employee titles that are elemeinated in where condition 

select Title ,VacationHours =sum(VacationHours) from HumanResources.Employee where Title in ('Recruiter ','Stocker','Design Engineer') group by all Title 

http://www.devguru.com/technologies/t-sql/7081.asp (in this u can see that without where clause also u can use having clause )

2. what is the peculiar use of primary key when we can use not null and unique constraint then what is the peculiar use of using it ?
answer : when u transfer data fromone database to another sometimes we have to write keys manually and then if we have primary key i can genrate keys in other table as well and it is the only key to establish relationship properly .


3. what is the exact use of shared class in vb.net ?

answer : I am having a module with public functions so those functions i can use it in my project 
but if i am moving to so some other project I have to create another module so instead of that i can 
create shared class and use it in any project that too wihtout creating object and it main use is generic functions and also to fill down some drop down list also like that we can use it ..


4. what is difference between .net remoting and web services ?
answer : The remoting is used mainly to make communication in the network ,and it is adistributed technology depending on tcp/ip protocol and works on 9040 channel In remoting we can distribute class library features and each remoting application we have to implement three different applications--class libary project,server application and clinet application .
In remoting, the applications involved in the communication process may be located on the same computer, different computers in a same or different network. In remoting, both applications know about each other. A proxy of an application object is created on the other application. 


Web Services - Communication between applications using web services is platform independent and programming independent. The application that consumes the web service, simply accesses it, without needing to know how this web service has actually been implemented & created. 

Now we are using wcf which is latest technology comapared to .remoting and web services .

 3. All questions very easy....and repeated ?
 
 
NIIT corporate division :
=========================

sql server 2005 :
----------------
1. what is schema binding in sql server 2005 ?

answer : SCHEMA BINDING is commonly used with SQL Server objects like views and User Defined Functions (UDF). The main benefit of SCHEMA BINDING is to avoid any accidental drop or change of an object that is referenced by other objects. A User Defined Function (UDF) may or may not access any underlying database objects, but in this tip we show how using SCHEMA BINDING with a UDF can improve performance even if there are no underlying objects.

Binds the view to the schema of the underlying table or tables. When SCHEMABINDING is specified, the base table or tables cannot be modified in a way that would affect the view definition. The view definition itself must first be modified or dropped to remove dependencies on the table that is to be modified. When you use SCHEMABINDING, the select_statement must include the two-part names (schema.object) of tables, views, or user-defined functions that are referenced. All referenced objects must be in the same database.

Views or tables that participate in a view created with the SCHEMABINDING clause cannot be dropped unless that view is dropped or changed so that it no longer has schema binding. Otherwise, the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Database Engine raises an error. Also, executing ALTER TABLE statements on tables that participate in views that have schema binding fail when these statements affect the view definition.

2. what is the use of instead of trigger is it applied for only views or it can be applied to tables also ?Then what function will it do for tables explain ?

answer :
INSTEAD-OF triggers are very powerful objects in SQL Server. They allow the developer to divert the database engine to do something different than what the user is trying to do. An example of this would be to add an INSTEAD-OF trigger to any table in your database that rolls back transactions on tables that you do not want modified. You must be careful when using this method because the INSTEAD-OF trigger will need to be disabled before any specified modifications can occur to this table.

Perhaps a more functional reason to use an INSTEAD-OF trigger would be to add the trigger to a view. Adding an INSTEAD-OF trigger to a view essentially allows you to create updateable views. Updateable views allow you to totally abstract your database schema so you can potentially design a system in such a way that your database developers do not have to worry about the OLTP database schema and instead rely upon a standard set of views for data modifications.

3. what is the use of linked servers in sql server 2005 ?

answer : If you need to access data from a remote server from within a query, it is more efficient to perform a linked server query (after having created a linked server).Linked servers are a way to link to different OLEDB compatible data sources from within SQL Server. One can create these links to either other SQL Server instances or even to other heterogeneous sources like Oracle, DB2 LUW, text files, MS Excel etc. 

A linked server has two major components:

• An OLE DB data source: It can be any database (Oracle, DB2, Informix, MySQL, Access etc.) which can be accessed through an OLE DB provider or it can be a file in different formats (Excel spreadsheet, Text file) for which an OLE DB provider exists.

• An OLE DB provider: This is the DLL that interacts with one of the above mentioned data sources. If you are using SQL Server 2000, then you will make use of either the ODBC driver or the OLE DB providers that are available with that version. In SQL Server 2005, you would use SQL Native Client (SQLNCLI) when making OLE DB connections to other SQL Server 2005 instances.

So, essentially a linked server is used to connect an instance of SQL Server to other data sources (Remote servers) which uses an OLEDB provider.  Linked Servers can be managed using Enterprise Manager or Management Studio but we will use T-SQL commands to demonstrate the use of linked servers. There are certain system stored procedures which we can use to create, maintain and to review the metadata related to linked servers. When you use the GUI, these are the ones that get used for creating the linked servers. It is always good to know the details rather than just using the GUI.

4. How many local variables u can declare in sql server 2005 that in a block ? can u tell me the maximum limit ?

answer : Not valid questions later on check it as it wa snot clear while asked by interviewer 



5. what is the use of variant datatype in sql server 2005 ? can i store all types of data in that ?
answer :
Microsoft introduced the sql_variant in SQL Server 2000. You can use the sql_variant to store data of an unspecified or inconsistant type  Or to store data of almost any SQL Server datatype.

A sql_variant can hold any datatype except text, ntext, image, and timestamp without conversion. For example, the following code will run cleanly:
http://www.dba-sql-server.com/sql_server_tips/t_super_sql_383_variant_data_type.htm
http://www.sqlteam.com/article/the-sql_variant-datatype

6. what will happen when two tables are there and for each table a trigger of insert applied to corresponding tables whether value will get inserted infinite no of times or any error will come ?
check this practically ?Means he is asking that this recursive trigger will execute how many times 
whether one time or not ?check it .

answer :32 is the limit i think 

Trigger events can be fired within another trigger action. One Trigger execution can trigger even on another table or same table. This trigger is called NESTED TRIGGER or RECURSIVE TRIGGER. Nested triggers SQL Server supports the nesting of triggers up to a maximum of 32 levels. Nesting means that when a trigger is fired, it will also cause another trigger to be fired. If a trigger creates an infinitive loop, the nesting level of 32 will be exceeded and the trigger will cancel with an error message. Recursive triggers When a trigger fires and performs a statement that will cause the same trigger to fire, recursion will occur.

7. Using sp_helptext u can view structure and code what command u will write to hide the structure ?
sol) 
C#.net and ASP.Net 
---------------------
1. what is use of properties and indexers in C#.net ?

answer : properties are used to send the value of form at run time and for indexers some explanation is below 
Indexers are one neat feature of C#. They allow us to access a particular class as it is an array. They are similar to the properties in means that they encapsulate method calls into more convenient representation of value access and value setting. Declaring a property you can access it with its name so it behaves like variable. The indexer is actually a class so it behaves as a type i.e. you have to declare a variable of its type (actually to instantiate an object from it but all variables are objects anyway). Indexers are also called smart arrays in C# and can be used to treat an object as an array. An indexer allows an instance of a class or a struct to be indexed as an array which is useful for looping or iterating or data binding operations. The following is the syntax of an indexer declaration. 


2. what is delegate and can i multicast same function again and again to that delegate ?

answer : yes we can do it i tried it many times 



3. can i write two statements in sqlcommand by putting ;and will it compile ?
answer : yes it will work but u have to use string data type to store the whole query dont write the query directly into sqlcommand 



4. what is Datatable Mapping in dataset ? or mapping of tables ? There is something 
   under datatable architecture like that do u know that ?
 answer :

Using DataTableMapping to name different tables in a DataSet,When you use batch SQL statement to retrieve multiple tables and fill a DataSet, the first table is named using the table name specified to the Fill method and subsequent tables are named using the name specified to the Fill method plus one. To avoid this situation we can create a DataTableMapping that maps "Employees1" to "Salary".
SqlDataAdapter dataAd = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Employees; SELECT * FROM Salary;", myConnection);
dataAd .TableMappings.Add("Employees1", "Salary");
DataSet ds = new DataSet();
dataAd .Fill(ds, "Employees");

so from above code we can see generally it is not possible to use two sql commands but if u want to use it use tablemappings like 

A DataTableMapping provides a master mapping between a table in the data source, and a DataTable that contains the results of the query issued against the data source. This class is used by a DataAdapter when populating a DataSet.

A DataTableMapping enables you to use table names in a DataSet that are different from those in the data source. The DataAdapter uses the mapping to match the tables when reconciling changes made to either the data source or the DataSet.

The DataTableMapping name can be passed in place of the DataTable name when using the Fill method of a DataAdapter. For more information, see Setting Up DataTable and DataColumn Mappings.

One of the important properties of the DataAdapter is the TableMapping property. This property contains a collection of the DataTableMapping objects that are found in the System.Data.Common namespace (because they're common to all providers). The DataAdapter uses the DataTableMapping object to map the table name of the Data source to the DataTable name of the DataSet. In general, the names for both sources can be the same.

Listing 5-51. Using DataTableMapping to map Orders table of Northwind database 

   private void DataMapping1()
        {
            // create a connection object
            string ConnectionString = "Integrated Security = SSPI;" +
            " Initial Catalog = Northwind;" + "Data Source = localhost;";
            SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString);

            // open the connection
            conn.Open();

            // Create a DataTableMapping object
            DataTableMapping myMapping = new DataTableMapping("Orders", "mapOrders");
            SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("Select * FROM Orders", conn);

            // Call DataAdapter's TableMappings.Add method
            adapter.TableMappings.Add(myMapping);

            // Create a DataSet object and Call DataAdapter's Fill method
            // Make sure you use new name od DataTableMapping i.e., MayOrders
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            adapter.Fill(ds, "mapOrders");
            dataGrid1.DataSource = ds.DefaultViewManager;
        }

The default mapping for a DataTable is the Table alias. If you use this mapping name, then you don't need to mention the table in the Fill method listing 5-52 shows an example using DataTableMapping with the Table option.

Listing 5-52. Using DataTable Mapping with the Table option

    private void DataMapping2()
        {
            // create connection object
            string ConnectionString = "Integrated Security = SSPI;" + "Initial Catalog = Northwind;" + " Data Source = localhost;";
            SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString);

            // open the connection
            conn.Open();

            // create a DataTableMapping object
            DataTableMapping myMapping = new DataTableMapping(" Table", " Orders");
            SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("Select * From Orders", conn);

            // Call DataAdapter's TableMappings.Add method
            adapter.TableMappings.Add(myMapping);

            // Create a DataSet object and call DataAdapter's Fill method
            // Make sure you use new name od DataTableMapping i.e., MayOrders
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            adapter.Fill(ds);
            dataGrid1.DataSource = ds.DefaultViewManager;
        }

DataTables are not only mapping things aliased in .NET. You can also alias the DataColumns using DataColumnMapping objects. The DataTableMapping's ColumnMapping property contains DataColumnMappings. You construct a ColumnMapping in much the same way you do a table mapping. Listing 5-53 shows an example of DataColumnMapping. The first order is in a message box using the alias ID :

private void DataMapping3()
        {
            // Create a connection object
            string ConnectionString = "Integrated Security = SSPI;" +
            "Initial Catalog = Northwind;" + "Data Source = localhost;";
            SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString);

            // open the Connection
            conn.Open();

            // Create a DataTableMapping object
            DataTableMapping myMapping = new DataTableMapping("Table", "Orders");
            SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("Select * From Orders", conn);

            // Call DataAdapter's TableMapping.Add method
            adapter.TableMappings.Add(myMapping);
            myMapping.ColumnMappings.Add(new DataColumnMapping("OrderID", "mapID"));

            // Create a DataSet object and call DataAdapter's Fill method
            // Make sure you use new name od DataTableMapping i.e., MayOrders
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            adapter.Fill(ds);
            MessageBox.Show(ds.Tables["Orders"].Rows[0]["mapID"].ToString());
            dataGrid1.DataSource = ds.DefaultViewManager;
        }

The framework automatically generates much of the Mappings, so you don't have to worry about them. But, occasionally, you may want to choose your own schema names for your DataSet that map back to the data source.

 
   
5. what is the use of XmlDataSource ?
answer :
The XmlDataSource control is a data source control that presents XML data to data-bound controls. The XmlDataSource control can be used by data-bound controls to display both hierarchical and tabular data. The XmlDataSource control is typically used to display hierarchical XML data in read-only scenarios. Because the XmlDataSource control extends the HierarchicalDataSourceControl class, it works with hierarchical data. The XmlDataSource control also implements the IDataSource interface and works with tabular, or list-style, data.
The XmlDataSource typically loads XML data from an XML file, which is specified by the DataFile property. XML data can also be stored directly by the data source control in string form using the Data property. If you want to transform the XML data before it is displayed by a data-bound control, you can provide an Extensible Sylesheet Language (XSL) style sheet for the transformation. As with the XML data, you typically load the style sheet from a file, indicated by the TransformFile property, but you can also store it in string form directly using the Transform property.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4881663/how-to-precompile-asp-net-4-0-to-a-single-dll-with-vs-2010

Precompiling an ASP.NET Web site project provides the following advantages:

    Faster initial response time for users, because pages and code files do not have to be compiled the first time that they are requested. This is especially useful on large sites that are frequently updated.

    A means to identify compile-time bugs before users see a site. (You can also accomplish this when you compile a project in Visual Studio.)

    The ability to create a compiled version of the site that can be deployed to a production server without source code. This makes sure that that people who have access to the production server will not be able to view the source code.

ASP.NET offers the following options for precompiling a site:

    Precompiling a site in place. This option is useful for existing sites where you want to enhance performance and perform error checking.

    Precompiling a site for deployment. This option creates a special output that you can deploy to a production server. The files that you deploy to the production server can be made read-only or updatable. The following sections provide more details about each option.

8. what is the use of DataView class in ado.net dissconnected architecture ?

answer : 
In ADO.NET we can create dataviews depending on the datatable values they are read only data types 
it allocates seperate memeory for dataview using datatable we can create default view and depending on 
default view we can create multiple views in front end 


The DataView class is very important to every ADO.NET programmer. Don’t overlook the necessity, flexibility, and power of the DataView class.
 
Consider this important fact: When a DataTable is bound to a form control, a DataView object is used as a “middleman” - whether the programmer explicitly codes it or not. If you do not code it, the binding process uses the DataTable’s default DataView behind the scene. Here is a simple diagram showing the relationship that is established when a DataTable is bound to a DataGrid control:
 
DataTable <-> DataView <-> DataGrid

To sort, filter, search, edit, or navigate a DataTable bound to form controls, a DataView is the best object for the job.“A DataView represents a databindable, customized view of a DataTable for sorting, filtering, searching, editing, and navigation.”

A DataView object provides a view of the rows contained in one DataTable object.  Only one DataTable is assigned to a DataView. The resulting view can be sorted, filtered, and searched. The DataTable assigned to the DataView can be edited and navigated through the view.
 
A major function of the DataView is to allow a DataTable to be bound to both Windows Form controls. A DataTable is bound to Windows control(s) through a DataView.
 
If you do not know that a DataView gets placed between a DataTable and a form control during binding, it may have seemed that you have been binding your DataTables directly to form controls. After all, you can write code like this that appears to directly bind a DataTable to a DataGrid:
 
DemoDataGrid.DataSource = DemoDataSet.Tables("Product")
 
However, when the code above is run, behind the scenes .NET will retrieve the Product table’s DefaultView (a DataView) and bind the DemoDataGrid control to that DataView, not directly to the Product table. In other words, if you do not provide a DataView object for binding a DataTable to a form control, .NET will use that DataTable’s DefaultView to complete the binding.

Extra Questions and answers in sql server  2005 :
=================================================

1. what is indexing and what is the use of it ?

answer : 

Data in the database tables is stored in the form of data pages .Each page is 8kB in size .so Data of complete table is stored in multiple pages ,when a user queries a data value from a table the query processor searches the data value in all the pages when it finds the result it returns it with increase volume of data processing of query takes long time so we have to use indexes mainly to acclerate queries 
with joins and performing sorting and grouping functions and to enforce the uniqueness of rows 

A clustered index is an index that sorts and stores the data rows in the table based on their key values 
Therefore data is physically sorted in the table when a clustered index is defined on it ,only one clustered index can be created per table Therefore u should build the index on attributes that have high percentage of unique values and not modified often 

Having clustered index on primary key is not the correct place if the table involving lot of joins based on primary key then u can apply clustered index on primary key but if u are filtering and grouping based on other column then u should not use indexing on primary key table and change the primary key index to non clustered index and aply index to most used column

so on the whole non clustered indexes are typically created on columns used in joins and where clause 
u can also create indexes on columns where values are modified frequently 

u can create 249 non clustered index in a table 

Without creating clustered index I cannot go for non clustered index 

 



2. what are the disadvantages of triggers ?

answer : 
Disadvantages(Problems) of Triggers

It is easy to view table relationships , constraints, indexes, stored procedure in database but triggers are difficult to view.
Triggers execute invisible to client-application application. They are not visible or can be traced in debugging code.
It is hard to follow their logic as it they can be fired before or after the database insert/update happens.
It is easy to forget about triggers and if there is no documentation it will be difficult to figure out for new developers for their existence.
Triggers run every time when the database fields are updated and it is overhead on system. It makes system run slower.

3. How will you enable or disable a trigger ?

answer : 

To know no of triggers in database schema


USE AdventureWorks;
GO
SELECT * 
FROM sys.triggers
WHERE is_disabled = 0 -- Enabled
ORDER BY [Name]; 
GO

The first trigger in the query above is HumanResources.dEmployee.  Let's use that trigger as the example in the remainder of this tip.

here i am enabling all the triggers in database 0 means it is enabled 1 means it is diabled ..like that 


this is for the single table 

USE AdventureWorks;
GO
DISABLE TRIGGER HumanResources.dEmployee ON HumanResources.Employee;
GO
 
 
Now validating the triggers whether it is diabled or not 

USE AdventureWorks;
GO
SELECT * 
FROM sys.triggers
WHERE is_disabled = 1 -- Disabled
ORDER BY [Name]; 
GO

Finally command for enable a trigger on a table 

USE AdventureWorks;
GO
ENABLE TRIGGER HumanResources.dEmployee ON HumanResources.Employee;
GO

You can go for graphical methods also by right clicking it from the object explorer

4) what is schema binding and how it is related to indexed views ?Explain ?

answer :
There is a view if u want to add an index to that view u cant direcly add it while creating a view 
u have to use an option called schema binding so that the tables which are formed or used in view i cannot drop them so easily as some dependency is there for them ,so we can even alter the tables which are involved in views 

5.) what is partioned tables and partioned indexes explain ?

answer :Partitioned tables are a new feature available in SQL Server version 2005, aimed mainly at improving the performance of large database systems. The feature is only available for enterprise and developer edition. For other editions you can get a similar functionality with a partitioned view.

First of all, we will create a partitioned table and prove that it is acting in a partitioned manner, in that the queries will only access the partitions that are required.

To start with, we need to create a partition function. This will define how many partitions exist, and the values contained in partition columns within those partitions

CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION MyPartitionRange (INT) 
AS RANGE LEFT FOR VALUES (1,2)   

The partition function has been named MyPartitionRange.

The partition column is an int.

'Range left' means that the value is the upper bound for the partition.

The above code will define a partitioned table that contains 3 partitions.

Partition 1 – Partition value <= 1
Partition 2 – Partition value > 1 and <= 2
Partition 3 – Partition value > 2

Note: that the range left / range right determines the partition for data that matches the partition literal value. For integer data this would change the partition number for all the data .

Now we create a partition scheme.

CREATE PARTITION SCHEME MyPartitionScheme AS 
PARTITION MyPartitionRange 
ALL TO ([PRIMARY]) 

The partition scheme is named MyPartitionScheme and references the partition function MyPartitionRange. All of the partitions are to be held on the primary filegroup.

Now we can create the table.

All that is needed is to reference the partition scheme naming the partition column in an “on” clause
CREATE TABLE MyPartitionedTable 
       ( 
       i INT , 
       s CHAR(8000) , 
       PartCol INT 
       ) 
ON
 MyPartitionScheme (PartCol)  
We can check the table structure via…

SELECT *
FROM sys.partitions
WHERE OBJECT_ID = OBJECT_ID('MyPartitionedTable')

…which gives…

partition_id         object_id index_id  partition_number   hobt_id            rows
------------------ ----------- --------- ----------------   ------------------ ----
72057594038714368  229575856   0         1                  72057594038714368    0
72057594038779904  229575856   0         2                  72057594038779904    0
72057594038845440  229575856   0         3                  72057594038845440    0
Now we add some data

INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 1, 'a', 1
INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 2, 'a', 2
INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 3, 'a', 2
INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 4, 'a', 3
INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 5, 'a', 3
INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 6, 'a', 3
INSERT MyPartitionedTable (i, s, PartCol) SELECT 7, 'a', 4
... and check that the rows have been added to the correct partitions

SELECT *
FROM sys.partitions
WHERE OBJECT_ID = OBJECT_ID('MyPartitionedTable')
… giving as expected…

partition_id        object_id index_id    partition_number hobt_id              rows
------------------- --------- ----------- ---------------- -------------------- ----
72057594038714368   229575856 0           1                72057594038714368    1
72057594038779904   229575856 0           2                72057594038779904    2
72057594038845440   229575856 0           3                72057594038845440    4

Note : With regards to creating partioned indexes refer NIIT book only change is clustered index we have to create on table and then associate with partition scheme

7. What is performance tunning in sql server 2005 ?

answer :  SQL Server 2005 comes with a built-in  the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. Combining a simple user interface with a deep knowledge of SQL Server, this utility can help you tune your databases for peak performance.

The Tuning Advisor handles these issues by introducing the concept of a workload. A workload is simply a mix of SQL statements that indicates the "typical" uses of your database; it gives the Tuning Advisor something to consider when deciding what recommendations to make. You can supply a workload in several ways. If your database isn't in use at all yet, you may have to deliver the workload as a simple file of SQL statements, typed directly into SQL Server Management Studio and saved to disk. In this case, the workload is your best guess as to how you think the database will be used.

But if the database is in active use, you can do better than that. The other way to generate a workload is to use the SQL Server Profiler utility to capture a trace file, using the tuning template. A trace file records the actual activity in your database over a period of time. If you record a substantial trace file - say, five megabytes or more, captured over a period of days - then the Tuning Advisor can tell you what changes would have made your database more efficient with the use that the database really got. I recommend that you follow this path to tune with real-world data, rather than guesswork, whenever possible.

otherwise check the d:\ folder some html file u will find the procedure of tuning into it 






8. Difference between sql server 2005 and 2008 explain ?

answer : In sql server 2005,There is no option to compress backup files, but in sql server 2008,there you find it. 

storing backup file takes 5 minutes without compression in sqlserver 2005,but it takes only 3 minutes in sql server 2008 for storing backup files with compression. 

cpu is used to compress the data before it is written to disk,so less data is written to disk. 


There are many new features, so it depends on what you need. If you store large files in SQL Server, migrated from Oracle and want to use date and time data types, need to encrypt your databases, etc you will definitely want to look at 2008. The nice thing is that it upgrading should be much easier from 2005 to 2008 than it was from 2000 to 2005. 


Server 2008 also added CMS which is Central Management Server. It only works with Windows Authentication but it allows you to management multiple SQL Servers at once. If SQL Server systems are popping up like weeds it will appear in the CMS provided that they point to the CMS via SSMS. Its a really cool feature. 

PBM Policy-Based Management is another added feature introduced with SQL Server 2008. PBM allows you to define and enforce policies for configuring and managing SQL Server across your enterprise. It goes hand-in-hand with CMS. 


One of my favorite is that fact that Reporting Services no longer requires IIS as it makes direct calls to HTTP.SYS. 


As Rajiv mentioned there are many improvements to performance, data handling, security, administration, etc...
there is not much diference... just higher version but still companies develop projects in 2005 only 

SQL2008 has support for additional datatypes: 
date 
time 
geospatial 
timestamp with internal timezone 

in additon it has geospatial functions so it can compute d


		 
9. what is the difference between a table variable and temperory tables ?

answer : The first difference is that transaction logs are not recorded for the table variables and they are excuted in a batch and used with output clasue to store result which output throws etc But temperory tables with # are meant for that connection and stored in tempdb and can used to transfer value from one stored procedure to another and they can be used as buckets etc for tranfering values between one query to another . Hence, they are out of scope of the transaction mechanism, as is clearly visible from this example:

create table #T (s varchar(128)) 
declare @T table (s varchar(128)) 
insert into #T select 'old value #' 
insert into @T select 'old value @' 
begin transaction 
     update #T set s='new value #' 
     update @T set s='new value @' 
rollback transaction 
select * from #T 
select * from @T 

s 
--------------- 
old value # 

s 
--------------- 
new value @

After declaring our temporary table #T and our table-variable @T, we assign each one with the same "old value" string. Then, we begin a transaction that updates their contents. At this point, both will now contain the same "new value" string. But when we rollback the transaction, as you can see, the table-variable @T retained its value instead of reverting back to the "old value" string. This happened because, even though the table-variable was updated within the transaction, it is not a part of the transaction itself.

The second major difference is that any procedure with a temporary table cannot be pre-compiled, while an execution plan of procedures with table variables can be statically compiled in advance. Pre-compiling a script gives a major advantage to its speed of execution. This advantage can be dramatic for long procedures, where recompilation can be too pricy.

Finally, table variables exist only in the same scope as variables. Contrary to the temporary tables, they are not visible in inner stored procedures and in exec(string) statements. Also, they cannot be used in an insert/exec statement.

 1.)what is Intilizecomponet in winforms u will see that so in that if i am changing some thing then whether architecture will change or anything in the code will change or simply anything will change or not ?
 
 sol) 
 http://www.functionx.com/vcsharp/general/appdesign2.htm
 http://www.dotnetperls.com/initializecomponent
 http://www.devcomponents.com/kb2/?p=1327
 
 InitializeComponent() method in Visual Studio.NET C# or VB.NET is method that is automatically created and managed by Windows Forms designer and it defines everything you see on the form. Everything done on the form in VS.NET using designers generates code. Every single control added and property set will generate code and that code goes into InitializeComponent() method.

When you run the app (or open the form in VS.NET), that code creates and configures controls just as you did in the designer. So every single change you make and control you add ends up in InitializeComponent() method. This means that doing things at design-time and run-time is essentially the same. Note that you should not modify this method manually since it might confuse the VS.NET designer. However you should use it to learn how to do things from code and how to setup controls and components correctly.

1. what are exceptions ?what is difference between throw and throw e ?
2. what is the difference between c++ dll file and .net framework dll file ?
answer ) c++ dll file is static where .net is at runtime it is dynamic 
A header file contains declaration of something (constants, classes, ...), usually ends with a .h or hpp extension.

A DLL (dynamically linked library) is a binary file (with .dll, .ocx, .a, ... extentions), containing functions, resources, ... and can be linked to your program at run-time. In order to use a DLL you need to include the corresponding header file, which declares things in the DLL, so that your program gets compiled. The DLL file is automatically loaded (by system) at run-time when your executable program invokes functions and asks for resources. 

A library file (also called static library, with .lib extension usually) is a binary file which also contains functions and variables like DLL, but resolved at compile-time, meaning they need to be provided at link-time.

Dynamic and static libraries are often provided together with header file (but no source file, which contains the implementation) when the provider lets you use his/her functions/services but doesnt give you access to the implementation.

1)what is the difference between response.write and response.writeline() methods in asp.net?

answer : There is no such method like response.writeline() only response.write is there and  so response.write() method writes the information to HTTPResponse and can be used to display strings in the output .

example: Response.Write("welcome"); 

But there is one method response.writefile 

Response.WriteFile(): 

Writes the specified file directly to an HTTP response output stream. 

example:- Response.WriteFile("demo.txt");


2)suppose i am clicking a windows application a window gets opened and again click another same window gets opened then like that if i click 10 times 10 times the window will open what should u can do so that u will get only one windows application eventhough u are clicking many times .

answer : u can use formobject.showdialog() or u can use foreach loop and put some if condition in the application and generally this problem u will  face when u are opening a mdi applications.
so finally u can do like this 

Use ShowDialog instead of Show, which will open a modal window. This is the obvious solution if you don't need your main form to be active while the child form is open.

Try to write this code :

SingleForm myform = null;

void ShowMyForm_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{     if (myform == null)
       {
             myform = new SingleForm();  
        } 
       myform.Show();
       myform.BringToFront(); 
 }

Give a null reference to a form and onclick event if the form value u have not allocated memory then assign it okay .

3)what is default paramter passed in C# .net ?(whether it is call be value or call by referene )

answer :call by value it is .
4)what configuration settings we can provide for cookies in the session configuration whether it is cookiees or cookieless?

answer : if sessions are used means cookieless  has to be provided with true value means sessions will think that i am not using cookies .

5)If i delete the manifest file will my exe file will run ?

answer : yes it will run .

6)If u are getting exception and u want to store those exceptions in the form of log files where  u can store ?
answer : U will use trace method for that where u can check at runtime what is happening in the system .

7)what is the difference between console.write and HtmlTextWriter.write method ?explain ?

answer : You need to write HTML programmatically using HtmlTextWriter. This allows you to generate a list of HTML elements, such as <div> elements. You could use StringBuilder to create the HTML, but HtmlTextWriter is better.Writes markup characters and text to an ASP.NET server control output stream. This class provides formatting capabilities that ASP.NET server controls use when rendering markup to clients. and console.write is normal way of outputing data in the form of strings to console.

8)what new control is added in .net 3.5 and what are the new features in that  ?
answer :
The  new features which are added are like this :

1)In ASP.NET 2.0, ASP.NET AJAX was used as an extension to it. You had to download the extensions and install it. However in ASP.NET 3.5, ASP.NET AJAX is integrated into the .NET Framework, thereby making the process of building cool user interfaces easier and intuitive.

2)The integration between webparts and the update panel is much smoother. Another noticeable feature is that you can now add ASP.NET AJAX Control Extenders to the toolbox in VS2008.

3)The ListView and DataPager are new controls added along with a new datasource control called the LinqDataSource.

ListView

The ListView control is quiet flexible and contains features of the Gridview, Datagrid, Repeater and similar list controls available in ASP.NET 2.0. It provides the ability to insert, delete, page (using Data Pager), sort and edit data. However one feature of the ListView control that stands apart, is that it gives you a great amount of flexibility over the markup generated. So you have a complete control on how the data is to be displayed. You can now render your data without using the <table> tag. You also get a rich set of templates with the ListView control.

DataPager

DataPager provides paging support to the ListView control. The best advantage is that you need not have to keep it ‘tied’ with the control on which the paging is being done. You can keep it anywhere on the page.
DataPager gives you a consistent way of paging with the controls that support it. Currently only ListView supports it as it implements the IPageableItemContainer. However support is likely to be added to other List controls as well.

LINQ

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) adds native data querying capability to C# and VB.NET along with the compiler and Intellisense support. LINQ is a component of .NET 3.5. LINQ defines operators that allow you to code your query in a consistent manner over databases, objects and XML.  The ASP.NET LinqDataSource control allows you to use LINQ to filter, order and group data before binding to the List controls.
You can learn more about LINQ over here.

ASP.NET Merge Tool

ASP.NET 3.5 includes a new merge tool (aspnet_merge.exe). This tool lets you combine and manage assemblies created by aspnet_compiler.exe. This tool was available earlier as an add-on.



9)Do u know about profiles in asp.net?

answer : Generally if we use sessions in alarge scale application load on the server will increase so i will create profiles for user where i can configure it later in web .config and based on user login i can change the color of panels etc or a web service which is calling some productid based on product color i will chnage the color of div tags and panels in javascript like that i can use profiles and these profile services can be used very well with ajax .

note : we dont have videos for this there is something in ajax but not so clear u need to refer pdfs so this much above answer is enough for time being to manage 

10)Reflection which class it inherit ?
answer : Reflection is the ability of a managed code to read its own metadata for the purpose of finding assemblies, modules and type information at runtime. In other words, reflection provides objects that encapsulate assemblies, modules and types. A program reflects on itself by extracting metadata from its assembly and using that metadata either to inform the user or to modify its own behavior. Reflection is similar to C++ RTTI (Runtime Type Information), but much broader in scope and capability. By using Reflection in C#, one is able to find out details of an object, method, and create objects and invoke methods at runtime. The System.Reflection namespace contains classes and interfaces that provide a managed view of loaded types, methods, and fields, with the ability to dynamically create and invoke types. When writing a C# code that uses reflection, the coder can use the typeof operator to get the object's type or use the GetType() method to get the type of the current instance.

refer : G:\CBT Nuggets Exam-Pack 70-536 .NET 2.0 Application Development Foundation\files\videos\n550 (refer 14th video ) 


11)difference between proeprties and indexers?
answer: properties are run time features when we want to send data at run time by encapsulating the data and when we have private variables and i want to access those i go for proeprties and 

indexer property in the C# language to provide a clear way to access the internal elements of the class. Properties such as indexers often access a backing store, and with indexers you often accept a parameter of int type and access a backing store of array type.

An indexer is a member that enables an object to be indexed in the same way as an array.

12)what is unmanaged code or unsafe code ?

answer : .NET supports two kind of coding
 
Managed Code
Unmanaged Code
 
Managed Code
 
The resource, which is with in your application domain is, managed code. The resources that are within domain are faster.
 
The code, which is developed in .NET framework, is known as managed code. This code is directly executed by CLR with help of managed code execution. Any language that is written in .NET Framework is managed code.
 
Managed code uses CLR which in turns looks after your applications by managing memory, handling security, allowing cross - language debugging, and so on.

Unmanaged Code
 
The code, which is developed outside .NET, Framework is known as unmanaged code.
 
Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said to be unmanaged, and certain languages such as C++ can be used to write such applications, which, for example, access low - level functions of the operating system. Background compatibility with code of VB, ASP and COM are examples of unmanaged code.
 
Unmanaged code can be unmanaged source code and unmanaged compile code.
 
Unmanaged code is executed with help of wrapper classes.
 
Wrapper classes are of two types: CCW (COM Callable Wrapper) and RCW (Runtime Callable Wrapper).

Unmanaged code execution proecess :
___________________________________
 
 source code (any language written outside  .net framework)
      |
	  |
 using native compiler or language specific compiler and ccw 
      |
	  |
  MSIL code (language independent within the .net framework ) 
      |
	  |
  using JIT compiler 
      |
	  |
 executable code 
      |
	  |
	CPU 
	  |
	  |
	output 
	
so u can see i am not using clr here if i am writing a code in accordence with rules defined in CLR it is managed code because everthing is looked after clr like memeor management ,security isssues etc and u can see i am using CCW some wrapper class 
in the same manner i can use RCW like this in the flow for unmanaged execution process.

now let us see for managed code execution :
______________________________________________

      |
	  |

      |
	  |

      |
	  |
   MSIL code (platform independent code within the .net framework)
      |
	  |
	using JIT compiler 
	  |
	  |
 Executable code .
      |     
	  |
	CPU 
	  |
	  |
	output 

 so finally i am concluding like this 

Managed code is code that has its execution managed by the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime. The .NET framework provides several core run-time services to the programs that run within it, for example exception handling, security, type checking, garbage collection, etc. Example of managed code includes all the programs written in C#, VB.Net, and other .Net supported langauges.

Unmanaged code does not execute under the control of .Net Framework while it executes directaly under the control of operating system. Typically applications written in VB 6.0, C++, C, Win32, COM, etc are all examples of unmanaged code. In unmanaged code the memory allocation, type safety, security, etc needs to be taken care of by the developer. 

Managed Code is what Visual Basic .NET and C# compilers create. It compiles to Intermediate Language (IL), to machine code that could run directly on your computer. The IL is kept in a file called an assembly, along with metadata that describes the classes, methods, and attributes (such as security requirements) of the code you've created. This assembly is the one-stop-shopping unit of deployment in the .NET world. You copy it to another server to deploy the assembly there—and often that copying is the only step required in the deployment. 

Unmanaged code is what you use to make before Visual Studio .NET 2002 was released. Visual Basic 6, Visual C++ 6, heck, even that 15-year old C compiler you may still have kicking around on your hard drive all produced unmanaged code. It compiled directly to machine code that ran on the machine where you compiled it—and on other machines as long as they had the same chip, or nearly the same. It didn't get services such as security or memory management from an invisible runtime; it got them from the operating system. And importantly, it got them from the operating system explicitly, by asking for them, usually by calling an API provided in the Windows 


13)Give me some of the reference types in C#?
answer : 
Value types differ from reference types in that variables of the value types directly contain their
data, whereas variables of the reference types store references to objects. With reference types,
it is possible for two variables to reference the same object, and thus possible for operations on
one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable.

user defined reference types are class types,interface types ,delegate types and array types .Reference types are allocated in heap memeory and built in reference types are dynamic,object and string .

so in this we know all the types but what is dynamic then 

The dynamic type enables the operations in which it occurs to bypass compile-time type checking

for example consider the example below 

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        dynamic dyn = 1;
        object obj = 1;

        // Rest the mouse pointer over dyn and obj to see their
        // types at compile time.
        System.Console.WriteLine(dyn.GetType());
        System.Console.WriteLine(obj.GetType());
    }
}

and the output for this is 

System.Int32

System.Int32

and if i chnage the code like this .

C#
dyn = dyn + 3;
obj = obj + 3;

A compiler error is reported for the attempted addition of an integer and an object in expression obj + 3. However, no error is reported for dyn + 3. The expression that contains dyn is not checked at compile time because the type of dyn is dynamic.
so this is the use of dynamic.



15)what is default running location means tcp/ip port for sql server and asp.net ?

answer :  By default (unless changed) the default TCP Port for SQL Server is 1433. If you have a named instance the TCP port is dynamically configured  and client ports are assigned a random value between 1024 and 5000.

open sql server configuration manager -->protocols for sql server-->TCP/IP (which should be enabled ) --->properties (u can check there that default port will be 1433).and default running port when i am using iis server is 80 and u can configure this port also okay .


16)Going deep in session in,out and what about how to store in  that session ?

answer : ASP.NET Session state provides a place to store values that will persist across page requests.  Values stored in Session are stored on the server and will remain in memory until they are explicitly removed or until the Session expires. 
session state is an object which lives in asp.net server per client.session default time is 20 minutes and it is the easy way to remember what the user has entered the data so far .The biggest advantage of session is u dont have to pass on data back and fro between pages in your application which u do in cookies and  querystring.

we can configure the sessions in web.config file using SessionState.next comes the mode property which exactly governs the where session state is stored default value is InProc which means session state is stored in memory on asp.net webs server.

<sessionState mode="InProc" />

this mode is fastest but all values will removed if do some change in configuration file or system reboots like that and another drawback is that this cannot be used in multi server enviornment where large no of users are available.

other values : sqlserver which is slowest apprach u have to provide connection string value also and session sate will be stored in sql server database and it can used in multiple servers environment and custom is used when u want to provide customized seession state manager later and if u dont want to use seesion disable it by off and stateserver means session state will be stored in  windows service etc like that we have different kinds of mode in session state to configure.

Off - No session state will be stored
InProc - (The Default) Session state exists within the process the web is using
StateServer - Session data is sent to the configured stateserver service
SQLServer - Session data is store in the configured sql server database

so Both the StateServer mode and the SQLServer mode allow Session state to survive an application recycle.  But, when storing reference type objects (such as class instances), they can only be stored to StateServer or SQLServer if they have been marked with the Serializable attribute.

Other commonly used Session methods are:

Session.Abandon() - removes the Session and all items that it contains
Session.Clear() - removes all items from the Session
Session.RemoveAll() - removes all items from the Session
Session.Remove("itemName") - removes the item that was stored under the name "itemName"
 
<sessionState 
    mode="InProc"
    stateConnectionString="tcpip=127.0.0.1:42424"
    sqlConnectionString="data source=127.0.0.1;Trusted_Connection=yes"
    cookieless="false" 
    timeout="20" />
	
	
	Attribute	Option	Description
mode	 	Specifies where to store the session state.
 	Off	Disables session state management.
 	InProc	Session state is stored locally in memory of ASP.NET worker process.
 	StateServer	Session state is stored outside ASP.NET worker process and is managed by Windows service. Location of this service is specified by stateConnectionString attribute.
 	SQLServer	Session state is stored outside ASP.NET worker process in SQL Server database. Location of this database is represented by sqlConnectionString attribute.
	
	Why use SQL?
Once you start running multiple web servers for the same web site, the default asp.net session state, InProc, is no longer useful, as you cannot guarantee that each page request goes to the same server. It becomes necessary to have a central state store that every web server accesses.

SQL Server offers you centralized storage of a session state in a Web farm. It also offers the transactional capabilities that provide reliability to most relational database systems. You can use SQL Server to save a session. This process is not as efficient as InProc and StateServer mode, because you must store the information in a different process or on a different server. However, this option may be more efficient than using the aspnet_state service, depending on the actual workload and the database configuration. Once you start saving session state to a SQL database it will also persist through web server restarts and reboots.

For example

<sessionState
  mode="SQLServer"
  sqlConnectionString="data source=server;user id=uid;password=pwd"
  cookieless="false" timeout="20" />
  
  In session state we have to store infomration specific to the user not resources of user .  A Session should come into existence when a user arrives at the start of a self-contained process of your application and should be removed by either a predetermined timeout (the default is 20 minutes) or when the user completes the self-contained process (so, if the user wants to repeat the process with different information, they won't run into any unexpected issues caused by their previous pass through).

  so this is alll about sessions okay .
  
17)how many versions are there for a file and explain different phases of each version?

answer : related to creating gac see in niit book 

18)what are the different session events in global.asax file ?
answer:

The Global.asax file (also known as the ASP.NET application file) is an optional file that is located in the application’s root directory and is the ASP.NET counterpart of the Global.asa of ASP. This file exposes the application and session level events in ASP.NET and provides a gateway to all the application and the session level events in ASP.NET. This file can be used to implement the important application and session level events such as Application_Start, Application_End, Session_Start, Session_End, etc. This article provides an overview of the Global.asax file, the events stored in this file and how we can perform application wide tasks with the help of this file.


Events in the Global.asax file

The following are some of the important events in the Global.asax file.

Application_Init
Application_Start
Session_Start
Application_BeginRequest
Application_EndRequest
Application_AuthenticateRequest
Application_Error
Session_End
Application_End
The purpose of these event handlers is discussed in this section below.

Application_Init

The Application_Init event is fired when an application initializes the first time.

Application_Start

The Application_Start event is fired the first time when an application starts.

Session_Start

The Session_Start event is fired the first time when a user’s session is started. This typically contains for session initialization logic code.

Application_BeginRequest

The Application_BeginRequest event is fired each time a new request comes in.

Application_EndRequest

The Application_EndRequest event is fired when the application terminates.

Application_AuthenticateRequest

The Application_AuthenticateRequest event indicates that a request is ready to be authenticated. If you are using Forms Authentication, this event can be used to check for the user’s roles and rights.

Application_Error

The Application_Error event is fired when an unhandled error occurs within the application.

Session_End

The Session_End Event is fired whenever a single user Session ends or times out.

Application_End

The Application_End event is last event of its kind that is fired when the application ends or times out. It typically contains application cleanup logic.

Using the Global.asax file

The following code sample shows how we can use the events in the Global.asax file to store values in the Application state and then retrieve them when necessary. The program stores an Application and a Session counter in the Application state to determine the number of times the application has been accessed and the number of users currently accessing the application.

Listing 1

using System;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.SessionState;
public class Global : HttpApplication 
{
 protected void Application_Start(Object sender, EventArgs e) 
 {
    Application["appCtr"] = 0;
    Application["noOfUsers"] = 0;
 }
 protected void Application_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) 
 {
   Application.Lock();
   Application["appCtr"] = (int) Application["appCtr"] + 1;
   Application.UnLock(); 
 }

 protected void Session_Start(Object sender, EventArgs e) 
 {
  Application.Lock();
  Application["noOfUsers"] = (int) Application["noOfUsers"] + 1;
  Application.UnLock(); 
 }
 // Code for other handlers
}
After storing the values in the Application state, they can be retrieved using the statements given in the code sample below.

Listing 2

Response.Write("This application has been accessed "+
Application["appCtr"] + " times");
Response.Write("There are "+ Application["noOfUsers"] + "
users accessing this application");

Exploring the Global.asax file in ASP.NET
 
Have you ever felt the need of writing logic at the application level; precisely a location or a file where you could handle events or errors at the application level? Well if yes, then enter the Global.asax. Using this file, you can define event handlers with application-wide or session-wide scope. In this article, we will explore the application and session level events exposed in the Global.asax file and how we can utilize these events in our applications.
The Global.asax, also known as the ASP.NET application file, is located in the root directory of an ASP.NET application. This file contains code that is executed in response to application-level and session-level events raised by ASP.NET or by HTTP modules. You can also define ‘objects’ with application-wide or session-wide scope in the Global.asax file. These events and objects declared in the Global.asax are applied to all resources in that web application.
Note 1: The Global.asax is an optional file. Use it only when there is a need for it.
Note 2: If a user requests the Global.asax file, the request is rejected. External users cannot view the file.
The Global.asax file is parsed and dynamically compiled by ASP.NET. You can deploy this file as an assembly in the \bin directory of an ASP.NET application.
How to create Global.asax
Adding a Global.asax to your web project is quiet simple.
Open Visual Studio 2005 or 2008 > Create a new website > Go to the Solution Explorer > Add New Item > Global Application Class > Add.
Examining the methods related to the events in Global.asax
There are 2 ‘set’ of methods that fire corresponding to the events. The first set which gets invoked on each request and the second set which does not get invoked on each request. Let us explore these methods.
Methods corresponding to events that fire on each request:
----------------------------------------------------------

Application_BeginRequest() – fired when a request for the web application comes in.
Application_AuthenticateRequest –fired just before the user credentials are authenticated. You can specify your own authentication logic over here.
Application_AuthorizeRequest() – fired on successful authentication of user’s credentials. You can use this method to give authorization rights to user.
Application_ResolveRequestCache() – fired on successful completion of an authorization request.
Application_AcquireRequestState() – fired just before the session state is retrieved for the current request.
Application_PreRequestHandlerExecute() - fired before the page framework begins before executing an event handler to handle the request.
Application_PostRequestHandlerExecute() – fired after HTTP handler has executed the request.
Application_ReleaseRequestState() – fired before current state data kept in the session collection is serialized.
Application_UpdateRequestCache() – fired before information is added to output cache of the page.
Application_EndRequest() – fired at the end of each request


Methods corresponding to events that do not fire on each request:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Application_Start() – fired when the first resource is requested from the web server and the web application starts.
Session_Start() – fired when session starts on each new user requesting a page.
Application_Error() – fired when an error occurs.
Session_End() – fired when the session of a user ends.
Application_End() – fired when the web application ends.
Application_Disposed() - fired when the web application is destroyed.
Show me an example!!
Let us see an example of how to use the Global.asax to catch unhandled errors that occur at the application level.
To catch unhandled errors, do the following. Add a Global.asax file (Right click project > Add New Item > Global.asax). In the Application_Error() method, add the following code:
 
C#
 void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Code that runs when an unhandled error occurs
        Exception objErr = Server.GetLastError().GetBaseException();
        string err = "Error in: " + Request.Url.ToString() +
                          ". Error Message:" + objErr.Message.ToString();
       
    }
VB.NET
Sub Application_Error(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
        ' Code that runs when an unhandled error occurs       
        Dim objErr As Exception = Server.GetLastError().GetBaseException()
        Dim err As String = "Error in: " & Request.Url.ToString() & ". Error Message:" & objErr.Message.ToString()
       
    End Sub
Here we make use of the Application_Error() method to capture the error using the Server.GetLastError().
Conclusion:
In this article, we learnt that Global.asax is a file used to declare application-level events and objects. The file is responsible for handling higher-level application events such as Application_Start, Application_End, Session_Start, Session_End, and so on. I would encourage you to explore the methods corresponding to the events and analyze the best possible methods to use them in your application, if needed.

What is Global.asax file: global.asax allows us to write event handlers that react to global events in web application.

How it gets called: Global.asax files are never called directly by user, rather they are called automatically in response of any application event.

Point to remember about global.asax:

1)    They do not contain any HTML or ASP.NET tags.

2)    Contain methods with specific predefined names.

3)    They defined methods for a single class, application class.

4)    They are optional, but a web application has no more than one global.asax file.


Events that gets fired with every request :
__________________________________________
 
1	Application_BeginRequest():	This method is called at the start of every request.
 	 	 
2	Application_AuthenticateRequest():	This method is called just before authentication is performed. This is time and place where we can write out own authentication codes.
 	 	 
 	 	 
3	Application_AuthorizeRequest():	After the user is authenticated (identified), it’s time to determine the user’s permissions. Here we can assign user with special privileges
 	 	 
 	 	 
4	Application_ResolveRequestCache():	This method is commonly used in conjunction with
 	 	Output caching.
 	 	 
5	Application_AcquireRequestState():	This method is called just before session-specific information is retrieved for the client and used to populate the Session collection.
 	 	 
 	 	 
6	Application_PreRequestHandlerExecute():	This method is called before the appropriate
 	 	HTTP handler executes the request.
 	 	 
7	Application_PostRequestHandlerExecute():	This method is called just after the request is handled.
 	 	 
 	 	 
8	Application_ReleaseRequestState():	This method is called when the session-specific information is about to be serialized from the Session collection so that it’s available for the next request.
 	 	 
 	 	 
 	 	 
9	Application_UpdateRequestCache():	This method is called just before information is added to the output cache.
 	 	 
 	 	 
10	Application_EndRequest():	This method is called at the end of the request, just before the objects are released and reclaimed. It’s a suitable point for cleanup code.
 
2)    Events that don’t get fired with every request.

1	Application_Start():	This method is invoked when the application first starts up and the application domain is created. This event handler is a useful place to provide application-wide initialization code. For example, at this point you might load and cache data that will not change throughout the lifetime of an application, such as navigation trees, static product catalogs, and so on.
 	 	 
2	Session_Start():	This method is invoked each time a new session begins. This is often used to initialize user-specific information.
 	 	 
3	Application_Error():	This method is invoked whenever an unhandled exception occurs in the application.
 	 	 
4	Session_End():	This method is invoked whenever the user’s session ends. A session ends when your code explicitly releases it or when it times out after there have been no more requests received within a given timeout period (typically 20 minutes).
 	 	 
5	Application_End():	This method is invoked just before an application ends. The end of an application can occur because IIS is being restarted or because the application is transitioning to a new application domain in response to updated files or the process recycling settings.
 	 	 
6	Application_Disposed():	This method is invoked some time after the application has been shut down and the .NET garbage collector is about to reclaim the memory it occupies. This point is too late to perform critical cleanup, but you can use it as a last-ditch failsafe to verify that critical resources are released. 
 
so this all about using global.asax files okay .


 
 
 
 
18)web config file how to do app settings why to do how to set databases etc ? 

answer : u know it and u have done it  also check in asp.net.txt configuration part .


19)what is the default lookup page used in asp.net  ?

answer : default.aspx.
20)how will u show session management or state management of sql server from asp.net some thing like that asked ?	

answer: This thing is disscussed earlier in sessions part only by using mode =sql server mode .


21)how many types of authnetication are there in asp.net explain?

answer: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/98950/ASP-NET-authentication-and-authorization

22)what are the different state management techniques in asp.net and which are server level and name some implicit objects of asp.net page ?
answer:check from the notes okay asp.net .txt .Now let us see on implecit objects in asp.net .

n ASP.NET you will find similar set of classes available like Request, Response, Page, Session, Application, etc. so Implicit objects are those which i can use directly and no need to declare and create an object like we have implicit objects in jsp .
Session Objects
Application Objects
.net Data Objects
Remoting Objects

1)How will u find a particular string in collection class ?
sol)

Dim StrArray() As String = {"ABCDEFG", "HIJKLMNOP"}
Dim FindThisString As String = "JKL"
For Each Str As String In StrArray
    If Str.Contains(FindThisString) Then
        MsgBox("Found " & FindThisString & " at index " & 
          Str.IndexOf(FindThisString))
    End If
Next

string []test_arr= new string[]{"key1","key2","key3"};
Boolean testCondition = (new List<string>(test_arr)).Contains("key3");
one more example is :
_____________________

public static bool ContainsAny(this string haystack, params string[] needles)
{
    foreach (string needle in needles)
    {
        if (haystack.Contains(needle))
            return true;
    }

    return false;
}

Usage:

bool anyLuck = s.ContainsAny("a", "b", "c");

2)Without using identity column how will u call a particular row ?

sol) u can use scope identity function to know the latest row identity value 
3)What is the difference between varchar and nvarchar variables in sql server ?
answer ) 
    nchar and nvarchar can store Unicode characters.
    char and varchar cannot store Unicode characters.
    char and nchar are fixed-length which will reserve storage space for number of characters you specify even if you don't use up all that space.
    varchar and nvarchar are variable-length which will only use up spaces for the characters you store. It will not reserve storage like char or nchar.
http://beginsql.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/difference-between-varchar-and-nvarchar/

The only difference is that NVARCHAR can handle unicode characters allowing you to use multiple languages in the database. NVARCHAR takes twice as much space to store to allow for the extended character set required by some other languages. So if you are not using other languages then definitley use VARCHAR for character data.

----------------------------------------------
1)Can a stored procedure returns  values if yes what are conditions and what it returns also ?
answer:Stored procedure may or may not return a value and if it returns a value it return under 3 conditions 
when it is 
a)returning result set using select statement .(it will return a resultset)
b)when it is using output variables .(it will return a single value or couple of values)
c)when it is using return statement .(it returns only single numeric value)


2)what is the main difference between a stored procedure and a function in sql server 2005 ?
answer :1) Procedure can return zero or n values whereas function can return one value which is mandatory.
        2)Procedures can have input/output parameters for it whereas functions can have only input parameters.
		3)Procedure allows select as well as DML statement in it whereas function allows only select statement in it.
		4)Functions can be called from procedure whereas procedures cannot be called from function.
		5)Exception can be handled by try-catch block in a procedure whereas try-catch block cannot be used in a function
		6)We can go for transaction management in procedure whereas we can't go in function.
		7) Functions are compiled and executed at run time.Stored procedures are stored in parsed and compiled format in the database.
		8)you can join two user defined functions but it is not possible in stored procedure.
		9) Stored procs can be used to change server configuration(in terms of security-i.e. setting granular permissions of user rights) whereas function can't be used for this
		10)stored procedure can create a  table but wont return table variables .

3)Can u give me a scenario where connected architecture is used ?
answer : 
When to consider using a DataReader:

The DataReader is a better choice for applications that require optimized read-only and forward-only access to data such as binding to a DataGrid control. The sooner the data is off-loaded from the DataReader and the connection is closed the better the application performance.
The DataReader is a better choice when you are planning to make repeated calls to retrieve small amounts of information or the data you are retrieving must be as up to date as possible each time it is used.

eg : payroll system .

When to consider using a DataSet:

The DataSet is a better choice for applications that will not off-load the query result immediately, or when there is extensive processing such as complex business logic involved between data accesses. The DataSet will retrieve the data, off-load the data into memory and return the database connection to the connection pool, where as a DataReader would keep the connection locked open until processing is complete. This could easily cause a high traffic application to run out of available database connections.
The DataSet is a better choice when you need to navigate through the data more than once. For example, if you have multiple controls you need to build off the same data, then a DataSet is the better answer because a DataReader can only be read once so it can only be bound to a single control and would require the data to be retrieved for use with each control.
The DataSet is a better choice when the data does not change frequently enough to warrant always retrieving it from the database or is specific to the user requesting the data. A DataSet can be stored in Session or Application variables or cached through the System.Web.Caching.Cache class to improve application performance by not having to retrieve the data from the database each time it is needed.
The DataSet is a better choice when building a Web service that will return the retrieved data. Since a DataSet is serializable it can serve as the return value. Since a DataReader requires a persistent database connection, it cannot be used as a return type from a Web service.

final conclusion is  like this :

if we will look for local storage system then we will found that Dataset is used to reads data from database and stores in local system where as for DataReader there is no Local storage is required.
so before choosing one of them while performing then you should focus on above points including you can select DataSet as a option when you are going for more number of operations(updates, inserts and deletes) on database and updates done in batch wise, then dataset will be best option. Use Dataset, if you are going to implement sites, which are no need of changes on every client clicks, such as "Carting in shoping mall sites", "display information in websites from database". where as select DataReader when you are going to fewer operations and directly implementation of queires on database, the datareader is best option. Use DataReader, if you are going to implement "Booking a berth in Railways", "display current price in Stock Market".
 
 
 eg:ATM machine has got local storage system and we remove and insert data in the form of transactions so here dataset is important.

differences  are like this : 
----------------------------

Following are some Points to be consider while choosing between the DataSet and DataReader objects.
DataSet Object has Read/Write access, While DataReader Object has Read-only access

DataSet Object Supports multiple tables from different databases, While DataReader Object Supports a single table based on a single SQL query of one database

DataSet Object works under Disconnected mode, While DataReader Object has Connected mode

DataSet Object is Bind to multiple controls, While DataReader Object is Bind to a single control

DataSet Object supports Forward and backward scanning of data, While DataReader Object supports Forward-only scanning of data

DataSet Object has Slower access to data, While DataReader Object has Faster access to data

DataSet Object has Greater overhead to enable additional features, While DataReader Object being Lightweight object with very little overhead

DataSet Object is Supported by Visual Studio .NET tools, While DataReader Object Must be manually coded


4)How will u implement security in website after deploying it at some client locations?
answer : 

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/98950/ASP-NET-authentication-and-authorization
G:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\four\TASP2W2_P2\VIDEO\L07
E:\Introduction To Asp.Net4 Web Forms\Security
G:\Lynda.com.ASP.NET.Essential.Training.DVD\12. Securing a Site with Forms Authentication
G:\Videos for ASP.NET 2.0 Beginners (9th video u check out)


There are different ways of implementing security in asp.net one is forms authentication and another is windows authentication so now 
in forms authentication we use web config file credentials tag along with authoriation tag also saying deny user =? means all the users which i mentioned in credentials tag only should be valid to enter so i will create one login page and take the values into variables and using formsauthenticate class i will redirect to corresponding page like that it works same logic will be there but u can use membership indirectly u are storing the values of credentials in the databse of sql server okay and a question may arises if storing credentiall in xml how many like that we can store then better u put it in membership which will have roles assigned etc things also okay .also go into visual studio command prompt and type some aspreg to install aspdb data base and then going in server explorer u can see that databases which has some tables to store username ,roles etc things so now u can use login control and memebeship.validateuser method instead of authenticate class usage u can do and next is windows authentication in this deploy the website in iis and right clik and go into security features and there u can uncheck ananomyous users and use basic auhtenticated user or integrated windows authentication we can do like this this security features work okay 
in vs 2010 u can directly right click and go to properties and check and uncheck ntlm authentication which takes windows os username and password like that also u can do it and in vs2010 for forms authentication if u register it will create a aspdb database at the background which we check it as usual from server explorer which we did for vs2005 total trainig things .
There is a graphical tool also available which is called as asp.net configuration website .project -->asp.net configuration -->security 

so it has got users roles and access roles after creating some users i can put them into roles and which user can access resources aslo i can decide .what ever we do graphically for that code will be written in web.cofig file only .when u try to access the security tab directly it will give error as u have not logged in after making an attemp it creates aspnetdb.mdf database on fly in appdata folder .so using this aspnet configuration i can make any file in my website secure or folder secure so let us see that imagine one folder with one page securepage.aspx is there now steps to follow 

after creating users i will asssign role to user saying admin by searching no of users from the list and providing role type to the user 

in access rules right side one folder will be there which will show your project click the folder which u want to provide security and provide the access rules by selecting radio button and all .so when i use adminstration tool it will create a sperate web.config file for that folder only we can check it .

so there is another tool aspnet_regsql this tool is used whenn many web application are sharing a common aspnet.mdf with them as no of users increses we cant provide seperate aspnet.mdf database to store so .so where u want to install this membership database is decided by wizard which we get from aspnet_regsql.exe tool.

so this is all about using security and u can implement that through security controls as well .


5)suppose int i is there how will u convert it into a nullable type and what is the use of nullable type and where it is exactly used in C# ?

answer : 

In C# as we know String is reference type and int is value type. A reference type can be assigned with a null value like string s = null; But you can not assign a null value directly to a integer. like int a = null So to make the value type accept a null value, nullable types are used. To make it nullable, a ? is added . in ? a = null; 

properties 
Value that gets or sets the value. A DateTime? will have a Value of type DateTime, an int? will have one of type int, etc. 
HasValue that returns true if it's not null. 

You can always convert a value type to a nullable type: 

Ex: DateTime myDate = DateTime.Now; 
DateTime? myNullableDate = myDate;


You want to see an example of a nullable int type in the C# programming language. A nullable type in the C# language can be constructed by specifying the question mark after a value type in a declarator statement. The nullable int can be specified with the syntax "int?".

This C# program uses a nullable int. A nullable int can be assigned to null.

Example
First, this example program demonstrates a use of the nullable integer type, which can be specified with the int? syntax. You can use a question mark at the end of a value type to transform the type into a nullable type. The program demonstrates a null int type, the HasValue and Value properties, and using the nullable type to acquire the value of the instance.

Program that uses nullable int? type [C#]

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
	//
	// Create a local variable of type nullable integer.
	// ... It is initially assigned to null.
	// ... The HasValue property is false.
	//
	int? value = null;
	Console.WriteLine(value.HasValue);
	//
	// Assign the nullable integer to a constant integer.
	// ... The HasValue property is now true.
	// ... You can access the Value property as well.
	//
	value = 1;
	Console.WriteLine(value.HasValue);
	Console.WriteLine(value.Value);
	Console.WriteLine(value);
	if (value == 1)
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("True");
	}
    }
}

Output

False
True
1
1
True

Question mark suffix. This program text is described in a compilation unit and the Main entry point uses a statement list in its method body that includes a local variable of type nullable int. Nullable integers are specified with the int? type; the int type is actually aliased to the System.Int32 type, and using System.Int32? would work as well. When you use a type such as int?, you have access to extra properties such as HasValue and Value.

HasValue property and Value property. The HasValue instance property on the nullable type returns a Boolean that indicates whether the nullable instance contains a set value. If the type is null, it does not have a value and HasValue is false. If the type is assigned to an integer, the HasValue property is true. Also, if the HasValue property is true, you can access the Value property without an exception.

What are Nullable Types in C#?

Nullable Types in C# are associated with primitive data types to make them accept null value as a legal value. Primitive data types in C# are integer, Boolean, float and double. Generally, these primitive data types do not accept null values. When null values are assigned to it, exceptions will be thrown at run time. To avoid exceptions and to make these primitive data types accept null values, the Nullable Types are used in C#.

Need for Nullable Types in C#

When there are hundreds of values mapped from the back end database to the primitive data types of front end application, there are chances that some of the backend database values might have null value in it. In such cases, retrieving each value from the database, checking it against null and then assigning to the primitive data type will have a considerable overhead in time and performance. This overhead can be eliminated using Nullable Types in C#.

How to Declare and Use Nullable Types in C#?

Nullable types in C# are instances of the struct System.Nullable where T can hold any primitive data type. Nullable types can be declared in two different ways. They are:

System.Nullable followed by VariableName
T? followed by VariableName

Definition

A nullable Type is a  data type is  that contain the defined data type or the value of null.

You should note here that here variable datatype has been given and then only it can be used.

This nullable type concept is not comaptible with "var".

I will explain this with syntax in next section.

Declaration:

Any DataType   can be declared  nullable type with the help of operator "?". 

Example of the syntax is as Follows :- 

int? i = null;

As discussed in previous section "var" is not compatible with this Nullable Type. 

So we will have Compile Time error if we are declaring something like :- 

var? i = null;

though  following syntax is completely fine :- 

var i = 4;

so this all about nullable types okay 


6)what is the default port in which sql server 2005 is running ?

answer : 1433

7)what is the default look up page in asp.net website ?
answer: Default.aspx page only 

8)what are the steps to create shared assembly in GAC?

answer: shared assemblies are module level dynamic link library ,In shared assemblies we can implement all object oriented programming features ,shared assemblies are located in the assembly folder ,when we are implementing shared assemblies 
we have to create a unique version ,using strong name key file ,and we have to add that unique version in shared assembly DLL file,
and this shared assembly dll file we have to install in assembly folder 

step 1:
******
code for raghuassembly class library file :
---------------------------------------------
namespace raghuassembly
{
    public class raghu
    {
        public string addstr(string s1, string s2)
        {
            return s1 + s2;

        }

    }
}

as usual build the application so that one dll file will be created


step 2 :
*********
creating snk file for this go to .net framework command prompt by clicking on start menu programs ->microsoft visual studio tools-->go to dll file location -->and then type in command prompt this

sn -k abc.snk 

here abc is optional u can give any name for this ...
and then one file will be created now i want this snk reference to be added in AssemblyInfo.cs

step 3:
*******
for adding snk file reference 

go to raghuassembly file of class library --> extract properties folder-->double click on assemblyinfo.cs file 
 and type the following thing
 
 [assembly:AssemblyKeyFile ("D:/Unique_Total_DotNet/unique_winforms/winformdemos/raghuassembly/raghuassembly/bin/Debug/abc.snk")]

 
 like this write down no semicolon should be added here 
 
 and then build application again and then it creates a dll file of it and this file will always refer to snk file 
 
 step 4:
 *******
 Installing shared assembly dll file in assembly folder for this open .net command prompt and then go to dll file location and write the following command 
 
 gacutil -i raghuassembly.dll
 
 step 5: 
 ********
 
 usage of above shared assembly demo 
 for this 
 
 refer programs ->usageofsharedassemblydemo   in winformdemos folder and u can check the interface how it looks there and the source code for this is below mentioned clearly .

code for usageofsharedassemblydemo:
---------------------------------
  include namesapce of dll :
 
 using raghuassembly;
 
 code in button clik event :
 
 private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            raghu rr = new raghu();
          String ss=  rr.addstr("hello", "world");
          MessageBox.Show(ss);


        }
		
so we can see the raghuassembly dll file in c:\windows\assembly folder ...  as this is shared assembly we can say Now.

is assembly okay .
		

9)what are the different types of stored procedures are there?

answer:1)system defined stored procedures 
       2)CLR  stored procedures 
	   3)extended stored procedures 
	   4)user defined stored procedure with parameter and without parameters .
	   
	   system defined stored procedure :
	   _______________________________
	   
	   In SQL Server, many administrative and informational activities can be performed by using system stored procedures. Every time we add or modify a table, make a backup plan, or perform any other administrative function from within Enterprise Manager, we actually call a stored procedure specifically written to complete the desired action. These stored procedures are known as system stored procedures, which are functions that enhance the basic functionality of SQL Server itself, either by extending the functionality of an existing system stored procedure or by creating new functionality that enhances the basics of what is already there.

System stored procedures are prefixed by sp_, so it is not advisable to use sp_ for any of the stored procedures that we create, unless they form a part of our SQL Server installation. Creating a stored procedure prefixed with sp_ and placing it in the master database will make it available to any database without the need to prefix the stored procedure with the name of the database. More details can be found at this link.

Let's clarify this with an example. If we take the sp_who stored procedure, call it sp_mywho, store it in the master database, and move to another database such as northwind, we can still execute sp_mywho, rather than having to specify the procedure in the fully qualified manner as master.dbo.sp_mywho. 

     CLR Stored Procedure :
	 __________________________
	 
	 Benefits of CLR Stored Procedures

Gives better results while executing complex logic, intense string operation or string manipulations, cryptography, accessing system resources and file management, etc.CLR Stored Procedures are managed codes so ensures type safety, memory management, etc.
Better code management and provides object oriented programming capability thus enables encapsulation, polymorphism & inheritance.
Convenient for programmer as CLR Stored Procedures can be written in C#, VB or any other language that the .NET Framework supports.
CLR Stored Procedures can also be used with Oracle 10g Release 2 or later versions.

with clr integration you can use managed code to excute a stored procedure .for this u need to create an procedure that refers to imported assembly .so what we are doing here is we can write all front end programming into the stored procedure like arrays ,file handling etc .
sql server 2005 is integrated with .net framework .so we can write managed stored procedures in this .

    Extended Stored Procedure :
	____________________________
	
	SQL Server supports the following system stored procedures that provide an interface from an instance of SQL Server to external programs for various maintenance activities.

An extended stored procedure (xp) is a dynamic link library that runs directly in the address space of SQL Server and is programmed using the SQL Server Open Data Services API. You can run extended stored procedures from the Query Analyzer, for example, just as you would normal stored procedures. Extended stored procedures are used to extend the capabilities of SQL Server. You can take advantage of the many extended stored procedures that come with SQL Server, or you can can write your own in a programming language such as C or C++.

but this procedure is removed from the syllabus okay..

  User Defined Stored Procedure :
  _________________________________
  
  u can check it from previous of your notes and alll ...not required.
  
  



	 
	 
10)what is dll is it an exe and in which format it exsisting and can u give me explanation in compilation process of C#?

answer:A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a file that can be loaded and executed by programs dynamically. The main advanatage in using DLL is several can use the same DLL during their execution.

Use of DLL (Dynamic Link Library)
 
Here are the key points that will guide you in understanding DLL. 
When we want to hide our code from the user then we make DLL (Dynamic Link Library) and add these in other application now no body can open this. 
When we want to use same code in different applications (REUSABILITY) then we make DLL of that code and add that code in other applications. 
When you want to use Functions of C# in Vb.net then you will make DLL of C# and add this library in VB.net and can easily use its functions. 

Differences :
-------------

1)
.Exe is readily executable 

Any exe file (calc.exe, cmd.exe, winword.exe, notepad.exe etc…) can be executed directly by calling the exe file name or double clicking clicking on the exe file.
It is not required some other way of instantiating. So an exe can run by itself but we need to just call based upon our need.
Example: - If we would like to open calculator in windows operating system.
i) Go to command prompt, type ‘Calc’ and press enter.

Or

ii) Go to “C:\WINDOWS\system32” and click on ‘calc.exe’ file available.

.Dll is not readily executable

Any dll file cannot be runned immediately or by itself. I mean we cannot do any thing with a dll file instantly. It can be used in application to prepare an exe file, so when we run this exe file it loads the referring dll file dynamically and links to it. So dll file is loaded and linked dynamically.

Dll file holds the compiled logic of methods or functionalities.
Say suppose to restart machine there could be a process or logic, this logic or process is written as method or function and then compiled.
This compiled logic can be a dll file. This can the be dynamically loaded or linked in an application or exe when and there required to restart machine. 

2)

.Exe has single entry point

Any file that is exe has only one single entry point. Main method is the first and the only unique method to identify the entry point of an exe file.
So when we run an exe file, the main method composed in exe file is called first and starts from there.
There cannot be more than one entry in .exe

.Dll has multiple entries

Dll is very opposite to what Exe is. Dll file is composed of the logics or compiled version of many methods or functions that can be used in exe by being referred.

So we can refer multiple different functions available in dll from exe file, multiple times. So it is said to have multiple entries.

3)

Exe is out process

When we run an exe file or application, memory should be allocated externally to run.
Since it has to be done externally while running an exe, it is said to be “Out Process”.

dll is in process
When a dll file is been refered with in an exe, so the dll file will be loaded into memory which is with in the memory consumed by the exe file.
So this is called as “In Process”.

Advantages of dll:
____________________
1) Reusability, Supports reusability of functionalities by implementing the generic function or method in a single dll file.
2) Dynamic, Can be linked and loaded dynamically, so changes made in dll file reflect at all instants where it is referred by either exe or dll.
3) Versioned, Dll can be versioned, such that several releases of same dll can be differentiated based upon version number.
4) Multiple entries, can directly call the required method available in the dll file.
5) In process, since dll is in process component, so any method calls or properties need not to be marshaled and which results to faster performance.
6) Low memory usage. Dll is loaded only when requested by a dll or exe and so memory is assigned or occupied by dll only when loaded or required.
7) Reduced swapping, if same dll is requested by 2 exe’s at same time or while one exe is running, then instead of loading the same dll it is loaded only once. A counter is incremented upon number of requests ande decremented when request is completed. So when the counter is zero, the dll is unloaded from memory.
8) Interoperable between languages, dll built or compiled in a specific language can be re used in an exe which might be built in other language.Unfortunately, there are few languages that support dll’s.
9) Efficient market support, If a release of application has been made and later there could be required to in corporate few changes.
In such case instead of re delivering the entire product, we can just re build the required dll and replace it in the delivered application folder where it is required to be.


Disadvantages of dll
_________________________
1) Any unhandled exceptions that could occur in dll leads to stop client process as dll is referred by application or exe but not executed directly. 
2) Dll Hell:- When we try to install a new application which refer to few dll’s, these dll files could also be installed along with exe. So, there could be situation where these dll’s could replace the existing dll files. If the version is different for both dll’s then the existing applications which refer to the older dll may face some problems while dynamically loading that dll file. So applications should be built in such a way to ensure back ward compatability.

Advantages of Exe
_________________
1) Readily executable, Exe files are very ready executable and can run on its own.
Disadvantages of Exe

1) Not reusable, Exe files are not reusable as dll files.
2) Should be very care full while running an unknown exe which could be a virus to collapse a machine.
3) Exe’s cannot be versioned as dll files.


Now let us go with second part of the question ..

Remaining u can explain in your own words okay .it is simple only after reading above url u will get the complete idea okay..

11)How will u explain to a fresher what is the difference between a class and structure ?
answer:
1. Classes are reference types and structs are value types.
Since classes are reference type, a class variable can be assigned null.But we cannot assign null to
a struct variable, since structs are value type.

2. When you instantiate a class, it will be allocated on the heap.When you instantiate a struct, it gets created on the stack.
3. You will always be dealing with reference to an object ( instance ) of a class. But you will not be dealing with references to an instance of a struct ( but dealing directly with them ).
4. When passing a class to a method, it is passed by reference. When passing a struct to a method, it’s passed by value instead of as a reference.

5. You cannot have instance Field initializers in structs.But classes can have
example:
class MyClass
{
int myVar =10; // no syntax error.
public void MyFun( )
{
// statements
}
}
struct MyStruct
{
int myVar = 10; // syntax error.
public void MyFun( )
{
// statements
}
}
6. Classes can have explicit parameterless constructors. But structs cannot have
7. Classes must be instantiated using the new operator. But structs can be
8. Classes support inheritance.But there is no inheritance for structs.
( structs don’t support inheritance polymorphism )
9. Since struct does not support inheritance, access modifier of a member of a struct cannot be protected or protected internal.11. A class is permitted to declare a destructor.But a struct is not
12. classes are used for complex and large set data. structs are simple to use.

12)can u tell me a scenario where structure is used exactly ?Do u think is there any use of structure in programming and where is it is used ?
answer:Structs are best suited for small data structures that contain primarily data that is not intended to be modified after the struct is created.
Classes are reference types and structures are value types. Reference types are allocated on the heap, and memory management is handled by the garbage collector. Value types are allocated on the stack or inline and are deallocated when they go out of scope. In general, value types are cheaper to allocate and deallocate. However, if they are used in scenarios that require a significant amount of boxing and unboxing, they perform poorly as compared to reference types. For more information, see Boxing and Unboxing (C# Programming Guide).

For additional information about value types and reference types, see the Common Type System.

Consider defining a structure instead of a class if instances of the type are small and commonly short-lived or are commonly embedded in other objects.

Do not define a structure unless the type has all of the following characteristics:

It logically represents a single value, similar to primitive types (integer, double, and so on).

It has an instance size smaller than 16 bytes.

It is immutable.

It will not have to be boxed frequently.

If one or more of these conditions are not met, create a reference type instead of a structure. Failure to adhere to this guideline can negatively impact performance.

13)Can u tell me a scenario where call by reference is used in real time environment ?
answer:u give them example where u actually want to pass address there u can use it like delegate ,class ,operater overloading all this will use call by reference only means when we want to add two objects and value inside local variables of oject has to be added like that .


14)what is cross postback ?

answer: Normally we use the term postback when an ASP.NET page submits it's content back to that page itself.But there can be situation when a page needs to submit it's content to a different target page.This is known as cross page postback.In this post we will discuss about how to handle and implement cross page postback scenario.

Now to make a page postback to another page we have set the PostBackUrl property as shown below:

<asp:Button ID="Button2" runat="server" Text="CrossPagePostback" PostBackUrl="~/TargetForm.aspx" />

Asp.Net 2.0 fixed this with built-in features that allowed us to easily send information from one page to another.

Button control has property PostBackUrl that can be set to URL of any page in our ASP.Net WebSite where we want to transfer all form values to.
Along with that Asp.Net 2.0 Page class has a property PreviousPage that allows us to get reference to the Page object that initiated the postback (in other words to get the actual reference to the Page object of the aspx page on which user clicked the Submit button on a HTML form).

So for example lets create two sample pages in our Web Application:  
SourcePage.aspx
DestinationPage.aspx
In SoucePage in Html form we will put two TextBox controls (one for First Name and one for Last Name) and one Button component  and set its PostBackUrl property to "~/DestinationPage.aspx". 

SourcePage.aspx:

    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
            First Name:&nbsp;<asp:TextBox ID="FirstName" runat="server"></asp:TextBox><br />
            Last Name:&nbsp;<asp:TextBox ID="LastName" runat="server"></asp:TextBox><br /><br />
            <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Submit To Destination Page" PostBackUrl="~/CrossPagePostbacks/DestinationPage.aspx" />
        </div>
    </form>

When our user clicks the Submit button, all the values from the HTML Form on SourcePage.aspx will be transfered to the DestinationPage.aspx and we will also be able to get reference to the SourcePage.aspx in our DestinationPage with the PreviousPage property like this:

So in our DestinationPage.aspx.cs code-behind we can easily access two TextBox controls on SourcePage.aspx and show them in two label controls like this:

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // first check if we had a cross page postback
        if ( (PreviousPage != null) && (PreviousPage.IsCrossPagePostBack) )
        {
            Page previousPage = PreviousPage;
            TextBox firstName = (TextBox)previousPage.FindControl("FirstName");
            TextBox lastName = (TextBox)previousPage.FindControl("LastName");
            // we can now use the values from TextBoxes and display them in two Label controls..
            labelFirstName.Text = firstName.Text;
            labelLastName.Text = lastName.Text;
         }
    }


15)do u know wcf,wpf ?
16)what is CLR actually ?
answer: The .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the common language runtime, which runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier.The CLR is one of the essential component of .net framework CLR is the environment in which all programs that use .net technology are executed.It provides services such as code compilation ,memory allocation and garbage collection.The CLR allows execution of code across diffferent platforms by translating code into Intermediate language .IL is a low level language that CLR understands .

IL is converted into machine language during execution of JIT compiler.during JIT compilation  code is also checked for type safety.Type safety ensures that objects are always accessed in a compatible way .
u can better go through niit book there with figures they have mentioned clearly .


18)what are the different types of constraints?
answer : unique,not null,primary key ,foreign key ,check constraint ,default constraint and i know about it no need to go deep here .

19)what is a transaction ,what is atomicity and what is isolation level ?
answer: we can asnwer this later 
20)ATM application is connection oriented or connectionless architecture ?
answer: connectionless 
21)A database is there with empid,empname and salary for that employee what u will use structure or a class ?justify ur answer ?
answer:we wil see later on 

22)string is value type or reference type ?
answer:

23)what are the different types of sessions?

24)How many ways are there to find second largest salary of the employee?
answer:http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/2012/12/how-to-find-second-highest-or-maximum-salary-sql.html

25)what are the different ways to transfer data from one page to another ?what is the difference between request.form and request.querystring?
answer : already u know ...querystring,cookies and session etc

   Now coming to difference between these things means 
   
   If the HTTP request method is POST, the user submitted data is in the
Request.Form() collection
If the HTTP request method is GET, then user submitted data is in the
Request.QueryString() collection

26)what is website navigation in asp.net ?
answer : using sitemap datasource and treeview controls and master pages we can provide navigation fromone page to another and u can use querystring also .

27)what is the maximum length or amount of data a string object can hold ?can it hold infinite amount of data or is there any limit for it ?if limit is  there what is the limit ?

answer : 2 to the power of 31 nearly 2gb 

28)Explain the concept of boxing and unboxing where it is used exactly ?

answer : Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type. When the CLR boxes a value type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object and stores it on the managed heap. Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. Boxing is implicit; unboxing is explicit. The concept of boxing and unboxing underlies the C# unified view of the type system, in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.

In the following example, the integer variable i is boxed and assigned to object o.

C#

int i = 123;
// The following line boxes i.
object o = i;  


The object o can then be unboxed and assigned to integer variable i:

C#

o = 123;
i = (int)o;  // unboxing

While the boxing process occurs, there is an additional memory loss occurrence. This memory is actually needed for pointer to virtual method and pointer to sync table which is not there in the case of value type objects.

During the unboxing process, however, memory relaxation occurs, but at the same time some unwanted checking (like whether the reference type variable is not Null or it is a valid boxed value or not) takes place.

If we compare Reference type and Value type Objects, then we certainly prefer Value Type objects. This is because as Reference types are coming from the managed heap/memory, they used to affect the Garbage Collection and memory management. On other hand, since Value types run on thread’s stack there is no need to be worried for a garbage collection to occur for them.

So, for these reasons we should avoid unnecessary boxing/unboxing processes and only add them when the application demands it. However, the fact remains that most of the developers are not aware of the underlying complications and they repeat these unnecessary processes unknowingly, which can lead to the degradation of the performance.
29)what is diffference between a string and stringbuilder class ? explain ?

answer : String bulider Can Be Used When More Than One String Can we 
concatenated.
StringBuilder which is more efficient because it does 
contain a mutable string buffer. .NET Strings are immutable 
which is the reason why a new string object is created 
every time we alter it (insert, append, remove, etc.). 

StringBulider Is more Effiecent Then String B'Cuse It 
Provide Some Standered Function like Append,Reverse,Remove
etc.

DOT NET – Difference between string and string builder

In Dot Net there will be many cases where in we need to operate on strings and first thing we remember is using system.String but there are certainly many points we need to remember and consider before we operate on strings.

1) Performance.

2)how many times we need to concatenate.

Lets take an example for concatenate five strings.

EX 1. Using System.String

System.String str =“My Name is dilip”;

str += “and i am”; str += “working on “;

str += “Post of “;

str += “difference between string and string builder”;

Response.Write(str);

and the expected output well you probably guessed it right

“My Name is dilipand i amworking on Post of difference between string and string builder”

Now what has happed? yes the important question now how many times we have appended the str variable those number of times string was created in memory location and abandoned when a new string is created and later waiting for garbage collection.

This leads to memory wastage and degradation of performance because string are immutable(that means any change to string causes a runtime to create a new string and abandon old one).

Think about the situation where in u need to work on 100 or more strings????

Dot Net has answer for it in the form of System.Text.StringBuilder class

EX2. Same Example using StringBuilder

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

sb.Append( “My Name is dilip”);

sb.Append( “and i am”);

sb.Append( “working on “);

sb.Append( “Post of “);

sb.Append( “difference between string and string builder”);

and the output is same as previous

“My Name is dilipand i amworking on Post of difference between string and string builder”

But this time there was only one string created in memory dynamically and modified as we append the new string, by this there is not much garbage collection and also helps improve performance. Append is taken only for example there are a lot of other functions which are just waiting for you to invoke.Happy coding.



smnetserv second round :
------------------------
1)I am firing executescalar () which is returning multiple rows will it throw an error or first row or last row ?

answer ) generally when  i am using executescalar() it will return only single value and if it is returning some set of rows then we can catch that into some string variable and we have to do typecast it and we cant read it properly into datareader class it gives error that system cannot covert implicitly the 
Error	1	Cannot implicitly convert type 'object' to 'System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)	

2)what executenonquery will return ?(1 0r 0 or integer value)
sol) http://www.codeproject.com/Questions/411100/what-is-the-return-type-of-executescalar-and-execu
     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.executenonquery.aspx
	 
	 For UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements, the return value is the number of rows affected by the command. When a trigger exists on a table being inserted or updated, the return value includes the number of rows affected by both the insert or update operation and the number of rows affected by the trigger or triggers. For all other types of statements, the return value is -1. If a rollback occurs, the return value is also -1.
	 
	 
3)can u tell how cookies or where cookies will be implemented in website ?

4)what is the difference between 3 tier and n tier architecture ?
sol) Both are same only nothing like 3 tier or n tier just for name sake .
5)how will u implement sessions in website ?
sol)

6)what is the difference between caching and sessions?
sol) G:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\four\TASP2W2_P2\VIDEO\L05 and then check some books of naresh technolgies as well okay to answer the questions properly .

caching can make a huge difference in performance of web application so it can make a difffernce between success and failure of website so that much important is what caching is .There are two types of caching one is output caching and data caching .output caching refers to the ability of asp.net to cache the entire output from asp.net web page .But with data objects u have to write the code to place data into cache .generally sometime it will take long time to create data sets so using data caching we can do it fastly so all low level issues can be solved using output and data caching .

output cache means whole page is rendered into cache for the duration we provide and what we can do is include substitution control where eventhough whole page is kept into cache that thing which we keep or specify in substitution will not it will respond to current request and show latest time stamp .so this is all about output cache we dont write much code in this okay .

some objects are expensive to regenerate like data set so keep those objects into cache and it avoids round trips to server instead of picking it from server for the second request it will pick it from cache okay .

Globalhunt :
------------

1)What is extended stored procedure ?
sol) Extended stored procedures are stored procedures that call functions from DLL files. You can read the article How to use extended stored procedures to learn more.However, extended stored procedures are deprecated and you should avoid using them if possible. CLR Integration should be used instead.

5)what are the different objects used in LINq?
6)Can i change the value of view state in textbox ?
sol) every control will have a view state and u can just enable or disable it and by defualt it is enabled because of which we can see the past values as well which we have entered when i concatnete the strings so u can do it .
7)what is cache and how it is different from sessions?

answer : Introduction: It is a way to store the frequently used data into the server memory which can be retrieved very quickly. And so provides both scalability and performance. For example if user is required to fetch the same data from database frequently then the resultant data can be stored into the server memory and later retrieved in very less time (better performance). And the same time the application can serve more page request in the same time (scalability).

for example it is diffcult everytime to retrive data from dataset so i can store an object of dataset in cache .

sol) no if u put primary key then only clustered index is applied to it .
2)what is a view state ?
3)can i make a class private and make it to compile and if i dont put any modifier and then if i try to compile will it compile or not ?
sol) u will get this error if u try to run a class by putting private before it as

5)what is authorization and authentication in  asp.net ? what is passport authentication ?
sol) 
6)do u know wcf ?
7)difference between overloading and overriding and what is run time polymorphism ?
sol) Overloading is when you define two methods with the same name in the same class but with different signatures. 
Overriding is when you redefine a method that has already been defined in a parent class with ther same signature.
Overloading is resolved at compiletime. Overriding is mostly resolved at runtime, depending on language and situation.
Overloading is know as early binding,Overriding is know as late binding
Overloading can be performed without inheritence but overriding can't

runtime polymorphism so it tells that base class object permission is required directly we cannot override the base class methods .
using System;
public class Animal
{
    public virtual   void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal sound");
    }
}
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog sound");
    }

}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Animal an=new Animal ();
        an.MakeSound();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
 
so in the above program if i cannot override the methods of base class directly so i declare method in base class as virtual .so this is run time polymorphism u do tril and error from all corners 
-remove virtual and use animal object this will not work because base class is having some method which the sub class is having (not compiled ) 
-keep virtual and use animal object but it will execute showing base class animal sound 
-so like that try some possiblities but using base class refernce u need to pass means that will also work calling dog because u have written virtual na ...so like that it goes okay .
But this thing will work 
using System;
public class Animal
{
    public  void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal sound");
    }
}
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public   void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog sound");
    }

}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Animal an = new Animal();
        Dog dd = new Dog();
        dd.MakeSound();
        an.MakeSound();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}


8)what is delegate ?where u  have used delegate in your project ?
9)what is difference  between  delegate and normal event handling  of .net ?
sol) delegate is a pointer to a method (instance\static)

eventHandler is a delegate with a specific signature (sender, eventArgs)

event is abstraction of accessing a delegate of any type, but it's usually an eventHandlerby convention
10)what is jquery ?
11)tell me the situation where u have used preinint() method in your project?Cant we use load method why should i go for this method to override the things ?

answer : generally some class  variable i want to intialize then i will use this method and to for user credentials information which i will enter one time i will put it in this method and some database connectivity method also .


12)what are the advantages and disadvantages of linq ?

After Marriage interviews done :
_________________________________

Questions on wcf asked by some company in telephonic rounds :

1)what are the security features implemented in wcf ?
sol) D:\WCF_ALL\wcf fundamentals\security 
     http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36732/WCF-FAQ-Part-3-10-security-related-FAQ .This question can be dealt when i will deal the subject more deeply on wcf which i have not done which i will do later as per the time table written but still watching the videos u can get some idea about it how to use and all.
	 
	 
    Confidentiality: This feature ensures that information does not go in to the wrong hands when it travels from the sender to the receiver so what we do is encrypting messages.
    Integrity: This feature ensures that the receiver of the message gets the same information that the sender sent without any data tampering.so for this we provide signing feature.
    Authentication: This feature verifies who the sender is and who the receiver is for this we provide proof of identity using username and passwords okay 
    Authorization: This feature verifies whether the user is authorized to perform the action they are requesting from the application.

wcf implements security by default in some bindings by default only .so wshttpbinding and tcpbinding both will have inbuilt security features and using some classes like securesecuritycontext which will return identity of the user who has  called the service we can check who is user and all in the program and some files will be gnereated when we click show all files and using svctraceviewer (write in cmd u will get one window and there u put the file to see the encrypted data )  if check those files  data is encrypted and so we can see by defualt cia security features are provided no need to configure anywhere .

u can use protecionlevel property which has 3 values : none ,sign ,encryptandsign so this property can be implemented at operation level ,message level and service control level so this is first mode of security which u want to provide in wcf .so when u are putting that property in program see that this will be provided by wshttpbinding and nettcp binding by default but basic binding will give error okay .so this the first level of protection which we can provide okay .

so now while configuring we have two modes transport and message based and also mixed of both ,and the other main configuration option is client credential type :username ,certificate ,windows and issuedtoken like this we can use in configuration purpose in app.config file and all .

note : so remaining things u can check with videos as i have written the stuff from videos only .

when u are using nettcpbinding encryption u can check in traceviewer file where as for transport it will not as it supports point to point communication and performance wise it is good and it has its own layers mainly it passes through ssl layer okay and message based commincation is end to end and it implememts common one through out .

mode transport with basic credential type -->asks uername and password (for this u will go into clientcredentials .username .username = and like that only pasword u have to provide otherwise it will go error ) 
mode tcp  with and credential type as windows -->no password is require so like this we can configure in bindings section and apply binding configuration to already defined one it is mentioned clearly in videos okay .


2)what if i am having set of variables which are data memeber of data contract class then how do i use xml  serlization for it ?

sol) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6exf3h2k.aspx
http://www.danrigsby.com/blog/index.php/2008/03/07/xmlserializer-vs-datacontractserializer-serialization-in-wcf/

3)what and all things are required for deploying an application ?
sol) already seen all the things above how to deploy a website in asp.net .

4)what is the manifest file and what and things are required for xap file something like that he asked ?
sol) it gives information about the project and xap is enough we can use that file to deploy where ever we need into the server .
5) what is dependency property in xaml and what is difference between wpf and silverlight ?
sol) it comes under wpf where u will do  binding of properties sometimes if the value it is looking for is not present in its namespace it will look for parent namespace and like that it will go upto application level also .

collebra interview first round :
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1)Do u know how to host a wcf service in iis ?
sol) when u go in deeep into the subject u can go for it no issues .

D:\WCF_ALL\wcf by example\hosting go through these videos this will be enough .

2)what are the componenets of .net framework ?
sol) clr and base class library and u can check bhopal folder in that refer presentation1 file that will be enough for introduction .
3)what is shadowing in .net ?
sol) http://www.4microsoftsolutions.com/post/Shadowing-in-C-using-new-keyword.aspx
If you make a member virtual it means it can be overrridden and still b able to be usable by the derrived class using the override keyword.  Using the new keyword actually replaces the base member and you cannot use base.MemberName.  With a virtual overriden member you can still access the base implementation.
There is video in d: drive check it is of questpond okay .

_________________________________

1)how to add two different arrays without using concat function of arrays and print the output ?
sol) http://www.dotnetperls.com/combine-arrays
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
	int[] array1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	int[] array2 = { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

	foreach (int element in array1)
	{
	    Console.WriteLine(element);
	}
	foreach (int element in array2)
	{
	    Console.WriteLine(element);
	}
	
	var list = new List<int>();
	list.AddRange(array1);
	list.AddRange(array2);
	int[] array3 = list.ToArray();
	foreach (int element in array3)
	{
	    Console.WriteLine(element);
	}
    }
}
2)how to show 2nd largest element in an array without using array function ?
sol) using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
namespace ConsoleApplication30
{
namespace ConsoleApplication30
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)

3)write a c# or vb program to access percentage of brands for a given brand in table ?
sol) for this u can refer J:\backuptotal\backupofe\churchsoftware on that day stored procedure was not written that much proper by me 
so u can follow this below which is same as above question as an template to clear ur idea of what u have to do and how to use it .

A person id is passed and he has given different types of offerings in the church now i am finding percentage of his tithe offering means one of the offerings which he is giving i am finding percentage of it so stored procedure and code for button click is provided so in the same manner  u can do it for brands as well by checking the scenario ok.
create procedure Tithe_proc22(@x int ,@percent decimal(10,2) output)
as 
begin
declare @combo3 int;
set @combo3 =@x;
declare @tithe_total bigint
declare @tit int
select @tithe_total =sum(Tithe) from dbo.offer ;
select @tit=Tithe from dbo.offer where idno=@combo3;
set @percent=(@tit*100)/@tithe_total;

return @percent;

end

                ll.Value = Convert.ToInt64(comboBox1 .Text );
                
                mm = cmd.Parameters.Add("percent", SqlDbType.Decimal );
                mm.Direction = ParameterDirection.Output;


                cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
                textBox3.Text = cmd.Parameters["percent"].Value.ToString();

4)write a query to find list of cities in karnataka in 2010 something related to group by and aggregate function .
sol) cityid     cityname           state        population        year 
      1         mangalore         karnataka      2000             2008
	  2         bangalore         karnataka      5000             2008
	  3         mumbai            maharastra     7000             2009 
	  4         davengere         karnataka      4000             2010 
	  5         hubli             karnataka      2000             2010 
	  
	  so based on above data lot of queries u can ask yourself so for this u need to be very good in select statements usage and group by aggregate functions u should be dynamic and it should come dynamically when u are answering this type of questions and also u should be good in joins as well so u need to following below urls provided for making perfect and not to forget the things on it in sql server okay 
	  
select count(*) ,sum(population ) ,state from states where year =2010 group by states 

so i tried from my side like this below which worked very much properly as per the condtions and things which i learned earlier okay 
create table states ( cityid int  identity (1,1) ,cityname varchar(30) ,states varchar(30),polulation int ,intheyear int)

insert into states values( 'mangalore ','karnataka',2000,2008)
insert into states values( 'bangalore ','karnataka',3000,2008)
insert into states values( 'mumbai ','maharastra',4000,2009)
insert into states values( 'pune ','maharastra',2000,2009)
insert into states values( 'dvg ','karnataka',2000,2010)
insert into states values( 'hubli','karnataka',5000,2010)
select * from states 


select sum(polulation)  ,states from states where intheyear=2010  group by states  

so this goes perfectly with group by so if the columns which u are not using in group by clause must
and should have aggregate function applied to it and if u are leaving the column without any aggregate 
function then 	it will not work like this for below   but in the where clause if u are using a column that will not have effect menas i want to say that no need to apply agrregate function for where clause columsn as it is giving result perfectly .

select polulation  ,states from states where intheyear=2010  group by states  

select polulation,states from states group by states where polulation > 2000

so above this also will not work so where clause column should have an aggregate function defined on it 

which will be like this 
select sum(polulation),states from states where polulation > 2000 group by states 


Note : columns used in where clause need not be applied aggregate function remember that but the columns which are not in group by and i am using in select clause u  have to apply aggregate functions to them at any cost in the above query u can see in where clause polulation is there but check the same population i am using in select but not in group by that is why applied aggregate function but this below query workd well 

select sum(polulation)  ,states from states where intheyear=2010  group by states  


because it has nothing to do with where clause hope now u got the point .
	  
5)write a query to find who has order more then 10 orders ?
sol) create table cust1(custid int primary key ,custname varchar(30) )

insert into cust1 values(101,'ravi')
insert into cust1 values(102,'mohan')
insert into cust1 values (103,'kiran') 

create table prod1(prodid int identity(1,1),prodname varchar(30)
,placedby  int  foreign key references cust1(custid))

insert into prod1 values('fan',101)
insert into prod1 values ('tv',102)
insert into prod1 values ('camera',101)
insert into prod1 values ('printer',103)
insert into prod1 values ('hairdye',101) 


select * from cust1 
select * from prod1

so now u have to fire a query how u will do that for the above question 

101	ravi
102	mohan
103	kiran

1	fan	101
2	tv	102
3	camera	101
4	printer	103
5	hairdye	101
so below is the solution which i got when i refered some queries .
SELECT placedby, 
 COUNT(placedby) AS NumOccurrences
FROM prod1
GROUP BY placedby
HAVING ( COUNT(placedby) > 2 )

SELECT custname , 
 COUNT(placedby) AS NumOccurrences
FROM prod1 join cust1 on cust1.custid=prod1.placedby
GROUP BY custname
HAVING ( COUNT(placedby) > 2 )

so in the above query when it is doing group by it will automatically find the count of each group and in that case i am finding the customer who has order more than 2 like this this thing will work .

capgemini interview :
________________________

1)what is the difference between tcp ip binding and http binding in wcf  ?

Basic binding

Offered by the BasicHttpBinding class, this is designed to expose a WCF service as a legacy ASMX web service, so that old clients can work with new services. When used by the client, this binding enables new WCF clients to work with old ASMX services.

TCP binding

Offered by the NetTcpBinding class, this uses TCP for cross-machine communication on the intranet. It supports a variety of features, including reliability, transactions, and security, and is optimized for WCF-to-WCF communication. As a result, it requires both the client and the service to use WCF.


2)what is localization ?

sol)G:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\four\TASP2W2_P2\VIDEO\L06

Globlization means removing language specific content from the website and localization means creating langauage specifice content for every language u support .First thing which we have to do is create resource file we have to remove the hard coded things from the controls and put it in resource files like removing text property etc things which will be created in App_Globalresources folder 
 
 so manually u can write code like this which u can check in video and when u build the application resources namespace will have the resource file defined for it and what and all values which u have defined for that u can assign to present controls present okay so this is doing the things manually.But if there are lot of controls we cannot write the code for entire controls so we have another mehtod where we generate resource files for page by page basis as well let us see that go to any web page say defualt .aspx  design mode then tools-->generate local resources now we get the folder App_Localresources here visual studio is creating for u everything earlier u were adding using add new item resource file and then defining and writing code manually now it is different so now using tools now it will have all the proeprties and controls defined in it u have to just provide values okay and work .Remember all properties of control cannot be localizable only few we can do .
 
      
 
 
3)Difference between local table variable ?
sol) already answered .

4)jquery he asked how to identify particular type of controls etc ?
sol) jQuery Selectors

jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).

With jQuery selectors you can find elements based on their id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more. It's based on the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own custom selectors.

All type of selectors in jQuery, start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().


5)when exactly we use left or right outer join do u have any idea ?

sol) http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins.html

http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/database-sql/sql-having-vs-group-by/
extra questions we can check it from : above url and u can tell below situation url 

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/ms187518%28v=sql.105%29.aspx

6)Inside a master page ,content place hoder and inthat one control is there tell me in page processing when init method will be called ?
7)difference between interface and abstract class ?
sol) same as above and earlier we disscussed and we can do like this one extra point abstract class : interface this is also possible .

8)Inside interface can i implement properties ?
sol) yes u can but it should be public and inside interface by default all things are public.

9)what is rest services ?explain ?

sol) check the video in D:\ wcf and then u refer the following videos of plural sight below for better and more deep understanding .
D:\WCF_ALL\Introduction to wcf\RestFul services

Notes : Rest means representational state transfer and it is nothing but using the current features of web in a simple and effective way .The first feature is http protocol which is 40 years old feature of web technology so rest first takes that one .and we know that this http protocol has standerd unified methods like put,post,get and delete and 3rd it is stateless and 4th is the uri uniform resource indicator by means of which u can go anywhere in web and locate the resource where it is .so it takes these 4 features of 40 years web and apply certain principles on it that is what we call it as rest .so now everthing in rest is a resource in interent we see images,files ,videos etc but in rest point of view it is a resource .and now second funda is every resource is represented by unique uri dont say .aspx but say shiv etc 3rd principle is use simple and uniform interfaces means comebine old methods of get,put,delete and post with resource name and 4th thing is resquest and response is done in form of representation. and 5th priciple is be stateless 

10)Tell me some set of interface which u have used and tell me some enumeration which u have used in .net ?

sol) Ienumerable ,icloenebale ,ipostdata etc and each one has its own use and icollection interfaces etc and fontstyle enumeration ,contentalignment enumeration and navigationstyle enumeration like that we have many kind of enumeration with us .


11)what is the use script manager file?

sol) we can execute services especially client side javascript web services using services tags which are light weight and we can give reference to scripts as well using scripts tag and then implement authorization and authentication and using ajax we can implement profile based service also very well okay .

Client-script functionality of the Microsoft AJAX Library, and any custom script that you want to send to the browser

Partial-page rendering, which enables regions on the page to be independently refreshed without a postback. The ASP.NET AJAX UpdatePanel, UpdateProgress, and Timer controls require a ScriptManager control to support partial-page rendering.

JavaScript proxy classes for Web services, which enable you to use client script to access Web services by exposing Web services as strongly typed objects.

JavaScript classes to access ASP.NET authentication and profile application services.

12)what is the use of updatepanel ?

sol) 1.ASP.NET UpdatePanel controls enable you to build rich, client-centric Web applications. By using UpdatePanel controls, you can refresh selected parts of the page instead of refreshing the whole page with a postback. This is referred to as performing a partial-page update.

2.When you use an UpdatePanel control, the page behavior is browser independent and can potentially reduce the amount of data that is transferred between client and server.

sol) 

we can call triggers also in updatepanel means asyncronus call on button click so u can hold a panel and right click and properties etc we can do 

the biggest disadvantage is that it still sends all the viewstate back and forth so you won't win a lot of bandwidth. Another one's that most of the page lify cycle still gets rum.

If you want performance and less bandwidth usage stick with Microsoft AJAX together with webservices. Return json data back and use javascript in the browser to make up the html and inject it in page.

13)what is function overloading and does in params can i go for different data types ?
sol) u cannot go for different data types they should be same and array function has to be at the extreme right corner okay .but same data types of array has to be passed u cannot put string and then params which i have tried which was not working .

14)In switch how many types of datatypes we can use ?

sol)A switch expression or case label accepts only the below data types:
- Bool
- Char
- String
- Integral
- Enum
- Nullable data types
 http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/183372/A-custom-switch-case-in-C

15)what is difference between union and union all explain ?
sol) In union all duplicates are repeated where as in union duplicates are not repeated . 

16)Difference between Web Services and WCF


Major Difference is That Web Services Use XmlSerializer But WCF Uses
DataContractSerializer which is better in Performance as Compared to XmlSerializer.
Key issues with XmlSerializer to serialize .NET types to XML

* Only Public fields or Properties of .NET types can be translated into XML.
* Only the classes which implement IEnumerable interface.
* Classes that implement the IDictionary interface, such as Hash table can not be serialized.

The DataContractAttribute can be applied to the class or a strcture. DataMemberAttribute can be applied to field or a property and theses fields or properties can be either public or private.

_______________________________________
1)Difference between string and stringbuilder class ?
sol) already done 
2)Give me real time example of when i will use abstract classes and when i will use interfaces ?
sol) already done 
3)what is the use of instead of trigger ?
sol) already done 
4)how do u do partion of tables ?

sol) u can check videos in below url : 
D:\certifications_MCTS\sql_database_devlopment_70-433\sql_2008\files\videos\n351 (check 5th video in this okay ) 

5)one scenario given like in a paper no of questions are there which will grade a faculty performance in excellent,good,average etc so create a table of your own where imagine some students are there and they have taken feedback form and in that questions are there and for each question they will have options same excellent,good avg like that so how will u design a table and how u will query on that explain ?

sol) For this i have used two tables one is questions table having questionno ,remarkofstudent ,studentid like that i tried intially so let us check some videos from J:\Lynda.com - Foundations of Programming. Databases (Allardice S.) (2013) and also put in youtube database design and try to download videos on those also once okay and then u try to solve the above problem from ur side by applying normalization and all pronciples which u have leaarned okay .


6)how will u implement exceptional handling in wcf?
sol) refer the following videos D:\WCF_ALL\wcf fundamentals\faults and exceptions and then refer google provided links below for theortical explanation .Not all videos are important just go through few videos upto typed faults and defining or why we are going for fault contract classes etc okay .

when an exception occurs at service side it has to be represented in standard format in soap which is called as fault means exceptions are technology specific and they dont cross boundary so exceptions has to be converted into soap faults and then again at client side imagine java it can be converted into exceptions like that it works so soap defines standard represention for errors which is fault i need a standard representation for my error or exception thrown by service because it has to transmitted accross wire with some protocol if u are using soap means then 

7)write a code in javascript directly such that any value written in textbox will be shown in dropdownlist when i click the button ?
sol)  u can write the following below provided code :
 <table>
                            <tr>
                                <th colspan="2" align="left">
                                    Getting TextBox Value in JavaScript:
                                </th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>
                                    <asp:TextBox ID="txt1" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="GetTextBoxValue('<%= txt1.ClientID %>')" />
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
	You can write the following javascript function which is executing above 
	
	    function GetTextBoxValue(id)

        {

            alert(document.getElementById(id).value);

        }

10)what is proxy class and how it is generated in wcf?
sol)
The proxy is a CLR class that exposes a single CLR interface representing the service contract. The proxy provides the same operations as service's contract, but also has additional methods for managing the proxy life cycle and the connection to the service. The proxy completely encapsulates every aspect of the service: its location, its implementation technology and runtime platform, and the communication transport.

The proxy can be generated using Visual Studio by right clicking Reference and clicking on Add Service Reference. This brings up the Add Service Reference dialog box, where you need to supply the base address of the service (or a base address and a MEX URI) and the namespace to contain the proxy.

Proxy can also be generated by using SvcUtil.exe command-line utility. We need to provide SvcUtil with the HTTP-GET address or the metadata exchange endpoint address and, optionally, with a proxy filename. The default proxy filename is output.cs but you can also use the /out switch to indicate a different name.

SvcUtil http://localhost/MyService/MyService.svc /out:Proxy.cs

When we are hosting in IIS and selecting a port other than port 80 (such as port 88), we must provide that port number as part of the base address:

SvcUtil http://localhost:88/MyService/MyService.svc /out:Proxy.cs

1)Without using inbuilt string functions how will print no of characters in the given string write a code on that ?
sol) int numberOfLetters = 0;
foreach (var c in str)
{
    numberOfLetters++;
}

or u can write a function like this 

int myOwnGetStringLength(String str)
{
    int count = 0;
    foreach(Char c in str)
        count++;
    return count;
}

2)Implement a generic function for swapping and tell me the logic how u will do it that ?
sol)

static void Swap<T>(ref T lhs, ref T rhs)
{
    T temp;
    temp = lhs;
    lhs = rhs;
    rhs = temp;
}

public static void TestSwap()
{
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;

    Swap<int>(ref a, ref b);
    System.Console.WriteLine(a + " " + b);
}

Swap(ref a, ref b);

3)write a simple program in C# to print prime no from 1 to 200?
sol) using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
 
namespace PrimeNumber
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            bool isPrime = true;
 
            for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 2; j <= 100; j++)
                {
 
                    if (i != j && i % j == 0)
                    {
                        isPrime = false;
                        break;
                    }
 
                }
 
                if (isPrime)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Prime:" + i);
                }
 
                isPrime = true;
            }
 
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
4)Inside a list box control i want to sort the values in ascending or descending order how can i do it ?(i told ajax write one function saying service=that method name )
5)when u will use triggers explain ?
sol) when we want to do some back up and recovery kind of things we go for triggers like bed example and update function will be there if somebody is updating a particular column i can fire a trigger and also i can rollback tractions and provide raise error etc kind of methods we have go nested and recursive kind of triggers as well which is one at server level and other at database level we have to write certain commands in the sql server to activate those nested and recursive kind of triggers etc and finally we can provide auditing functioning also through ddl trigers so this is alll about triggers .

6)Do u know u have triggers in wpf as welll?
7)How does regular binding differ from dependency binding ?

10)Do u know bubbling and routing of events in wpf ?
sol)Bubling and routing means under one control if u are having another control and for the top control u have defined events for it then if u forget to fire any events then parent event is fired and routing means which control is activating the event etc like that it is totally a wpf one .

1)one wcf service is there which is used by all the people imagine one guy has changed the wcf parameter and republish it and using it then remaining user when they try to access that wcf service they get error how will see that the error may not come ?

2)how will u implement exceptional handling in asp.net ajax imagine updatepanel u are using and some error has come how u will resolve those error that i am asking ?

3)imagine a table is there with name ,city,age u have written a stored procedure to enter values in that table now some user from database side logged in and and inserted some values in table  so i have added another paramter in stored procedure that as user and how i will know that user has only changed the value how i will get the value in trigger (confusing ) .

4)can u call  a stored procedure inside a function and vice versa ?

answer ) we can call a function inside a stored procedure but reverse is not possible means inside a function u cannot call stored procedure as stored proecedure is meant for some permenant changes in database .

5)u know u will use generic functions for common things now imagine salary u want to retrive how u will do that in generic and later student data u are storing u want to retrive marks how u will do it ?


Accenture with WCF:
___________________
1)can we implement sessions in wcf and how we can do that ?
sol)D:\Sessions video is there check that once so in this on the top of service contract attribute just include [ServiceContract(session = true)] then some set of messages will be commmunicated between client and the wcf service which we can see in trace file automatically some communication will happen .so now for every proxy i want to create a new color or provide a new color to the message which i am printing in my service contract which has got some method defined for printing .so we can say some kind of comunication has been established between client and service .so in the print message i can include a seesion identifier like this 
string sessionID=OperationContext.current .SessionIdentifier ;
and then print it like this 

console.writeline("sessionid:{0}  ,message : {1} " ,sessionid,message );

so like this i can use basis session functionality 

then refer D:\WCF_ALL\wcf advanced topics\Runtime execution(per call ,per session and single demos once ) and so these videos provide a very good knowledge just go through them and in session also we have required ,not required etc things because if some new person is trying to  use a binding endpoint which is not supported if i write required then it warns me that this is not supporting then we can take appropriate action that not to configure my service with endpoint which is not supporting sessions in them so nettcp binding by default support it and other wont but can be supported through sooap protocols if we provide explicityly some way out into it .then then finally go through following below links from google  .

1)same repeated questions ?
2)Tell me the scenario where sealed class is used ?
3)Tell me the architecture of your project and explain any project of your choice okay ?
4)how will u implement exceptional handling in asp.net ?
sol)using exceptional handling we can implement and imagine there is a situation where detailsview is there and u are trying to delete a row and as reference is there u cannot then how u will hanlde those events so there are events one which will before event and other which will occur after for before we can say e.cancel =true means before inserting i am not allowing it to insert okay so like this before events are handled and after insertevent has occured or deleted event is occure there is another way to handle it  and in deleted event we set some label instead of showing those regular pages of asp.net i can set lable or error pages .


capgemini face to face round :
______________________________

1)what is the use of var ? Is it compile time or runtime explain ?

var x="hello";
x=x+1;
what it will give compile time errror if it gives compile time error how can u say that it is run time okay .so it is totally compile time and we cannot declare multiple variables like this in this.
sol) check the following urls this will be help ful

 http://beyondrelational.com/modules/2/blogs/79/posts/11536/when-to-use-var-keyword-in-c.aspx
 http://www.devcurry.com/2010/09/var-vs-dynamic-keyword-in-c-40.html

2)Explain page processing life cycle where is preinit method is used ?

sol) suppose in a page some set of fonts i want to change then i will use this preinit method fon size=4 to 6 like that he only told me .These and all are repeated questions u can check the answers from above list i have added a new statement which was told by the concerned person while taking interview .


4) what stored procedures u have used give me one example based on one stored procedure i want to call another stored procedure how u will do that ?
sol) http://www.aspfree.com/c/a/asp-net-code/call-stored-procedure-from-within-another-stored-procedure-return-values/
   Nothing but u will use nested stored procedures thats all .u can go table variables and exec stored procedure into that table variables and u   
   can go for output variables to catch inserted and deleted values and also temp tables also u pass values from one stored procedure to another .
   so u can cover this question by talking like this so that he can think that something has been done by him.
   
5)Glabal .asax file what is the use of it write the code for it how many time a page visited by a user ?
sol) The solution to this one is already written on top u didnt practised that is why he asked u to write the code if u had written immedetely it would be good impreesion on him so it is a repeated question only .

6)suppose a page is having post back as true and one button is there whose autopostback property is false what will happen to button will it change the autopost back to true ?

sol) http://www.dotnetspider.com/resources/189-AutoPostBack-What-How-works.aspx no it will not change this autopostback property is used when i am selecting something from dropdownlist based on that updated value i want to get some results and if i dont set it to true the effect we can see there we will use this autopostback property for example based on state selected on one dropdown list i want to use see all the towns in that state so this is possible only setting combobox autopostback proerty to true .


8)when the page loads say test.aspx then first what it calls not events i am aksing which method will it call what is the life cycle ?
http://www.dotnettutorials.com/tutorials/performance/page-life-cycle-asp.aspx using this url u may get some idea i am not that much sure about this 
9) what is other way of using exsists function inside a stored procedure ?
sol) you can go for a subquery as well inside a stored procedure okay 
10)what are hidden fields in asp.net ?
sol) http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/492397/State-Management-in-ASP-NET-Introduction

1) what is the advantages of generics exaplin and give three uses ?

sol) type safety ,performence increases and boxing and unboxing problems wont come when we use this .

2) what are different ways of implementing interfaces explain how will u write code for explicit implementation of interface ?

4) which modifier can i use in interfaces ?
sol)Public is default access modifier for interface members. There is no use with other access modifiers as the interfaces has to be implemented by the other classes. So only public access modifier is allowed for interface members.

6) what is the difference between xsl and xslt ?
sol) I have seen XSL and XSLT used interchangeably in the Web developer world. It is, however, helpful to know the difference. XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is the superset of XSLT as it includes XSLT and XSL formatting objects. By using the term XSL, they implicitly mean XSLT. 

XSL is a language for expressing stylesheets. It consists of three parts:
* XSL Transformations (XSLT): a language for transforming XML documents
* The XML Path Language (XPath): an expression language used by XSLT to access or refer to parts of an XML document.
* An XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics (XSL Formatting Objects)
Informally, abbreviation "XSL" often refers to XSLT only, since the latter is in wider use. Also informally ?XSLT? often refers to both ?XSLT itself? and ?XPath?, since most of XSLT document use XPath expressions.

9)what is the difference between machine.config file and web.config file ?
sol) The machine.config is the ultimate master config file on your system with a lot of default settings.
When you use web.config files, it is for your application. It's advised to keep the machine.config as is as much as possible so to not get conflicts with other applications

web.config is configure application only
machine.config file related to ur all d application on server
 
web.config file are applied to that particular web application only
machine.config file are applied to the all managed application
 
web.config file exists within the web application,
machine.config file exists in the
c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\version\config file
 
 
 web.config: It is the main settings and configuration file for an ASP.NET web application. The file is an XML document that defines configuration information regarding the web application. The web.config file contains information that control module loading, security configuration, session state configuration, and application language and compilation settings. Web.config files can also contain application specific items such as database connection strings.
 
machine.config: It contains settings that apply to an entire computer. This file is located in the %runtime install path%\Config directory. Machine.config contains configuration settings for machine-wide assembly binding, built-in remoting channels, and ASP.NET.

The Machine.Config file, which specifies the settings that are global to a particular machine. This file is located at the following path:

 \WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\[Framework Version]\CONFIG\machine.config

    As web.config file is used to configure one asp .net web application, same way Machine.config file is used to configure the application according to a particular machine. That is, configuration done in machine.config file is affected on any application that runs on a particular machine. Usually, this file is not altered and only web.config is used which configuring applications.

 You can override settings in the Machine.Config file for all the applications in a particular Web site by placing a Web.Config file in the root directory of the Web site as follows:

\InetPub\wwwroot\Web.Config

 

mindtree interview :
_____________________

based on design patteren singleton class one interface was there and few classes he was asking me to write test cases and code was partially done u have to complete the code ?It was about class diagrams and data flow diagrams given means what and all set and get methods written in the class for that we can see in the diagram as well and design specification and low level design was given also for that .



sol) For this u can download design pateerens from pluralsight where demo of each is given okay .just like wcf one window was coming for nunit test so u have to get grip on this thing as well .


visio net systems :
______________________

1)can u use variables inside an interface or inside an abstract class ?
sol) No we cant use we can use them as properties only but in the derived class u can use variables okay .

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944432/can-we-add-variables-and-properties-in-interfaces-in-c-net

2)can u implement polymorphism in abstract class give me one real time scenario in your project for polymorphism ?

sol)This is nothing but asking what is virutal functions so in abastract classes u can declare some methods as virtual and can be used so this is the solution and if u look the url below u will understand more better .so virtual functions may or may not be overriden in sub clases but abstract methods have to be overriden .

http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/pcurnow/abspolymorph08292007095011AM/abspolymorph.aspx
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1771741/how-to-force-sub-classes-to-implement-a-method
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_polymorphism.htm

Note : Abstract classes cannot be declared as sealed .
Note:Virtual method has an implementation & provide the derived class with the option of overriding it. Abstract method does not provide an implementation & forces the derived class to override the method. 
Note:An Abstract method must be override in child classes where as virtual method is not compulsory to override.
An abstract method doesn't have implementation detail where as virtual method has it.
only abstract class can haveabstract method, any class can have virtual method

3)U  are having two interfaces and they are having common function defined in them then if one class is implementing both the interfaces how will u differentiate the methods of interface will it give compile time error ?

sol) u have to declare interface objects and use it explicitly instead simple doing : I1 a ,I2 b like this okay This is nothing but explicit way of declaring interfaces and using it putting infce.classname or method u cna do it u can check the examples in the previous questions okay .


5)without using statemanagement technique and global.asax file what u have to do is imagine u are calling anywebsite how the person knows that u have called the website through this system in the same manner if u are calling the website from some other system i should be able to know that system address like that ?

sol) drop a literal label on the page and name its id as litersessionid and in page load event call this method 

this.litersessionid.text=session.sessionid 

so when u view in browser a literal text value will contain the some random generated code for the page .



6)There is a table say cities with citiid ,cityname etc and with single update statment i want to change mangalore to bangalore how u can do it ?

sol) u can use a replace method or fire a subquery for that particular replacement okay .

7) There are two tables emp(empid ,empname ,deptid) and dept(deptid,deptname)

wrrite a join query in such a manner that i should get deptname and no of employees working in that dept ?( so u need to practise welll on joins people will ask on this and i think u can do it using left or right outer join ) try it same question was asked in bob technologies as well i think .
sol) 
create table emp(empid int primary key ,empname varchar(30) ,deptid int foreign key references dept(deptid))
create table dept (deptid int primary key ,deptname varchar(30))

insert into dept values ( 1001,'Marketing');
insert into dept values ( 1002 ,'Sales');
insert into dept values (1003 ,'HR');

insert into emp values ( 101,'mohan',1001)
insert into emp values (102,'kiran',1002)
insert into emp values (103 ,'madhu',1003)
insert into emp values ( 104 ,'raghu',1001)
insert into emp values (105,'priya',1001)
insert into emp values (106,'girish',1002)

select * from emp 
select * from dept 

select deptname ,count(empid) as No_Of_employees from emp join dept on emp.deptid=dept.deptid group by deptname

1)Inside a div tag another div tag is there how will u provide proper spacing across all corners in between them ?

sol) Go to dreamweaver drag and drop two div tags one inside the other and check the code in source code by switching into source code from design code .

2)what is the difference between padding and margin ?
sol) no that much important .
3)There is a method in aspx page and in that i had put one user control how will access the method of that aspx page in user control ?
sol)u have kept one label control in webusercontrol and one method is there with the name message in default.aspx page so i need to override that method like below whole source code u can see it from http://www.dotnetfunda.com/articles/article1094-accessing-a-method-of-aspx-page-into-a-user-control.aspx 
override protected void OnLoad(EventArgs e)
{
   lblTest.Text = ((_Default)this.Page).message();
}

4)Inside a page a user control is there in that one textbox is there how will i access the user controls text box property or retirve its value ?

sol) u cannot directly accesss usercontrols control imagine one textbox is there those values u want to put it in another textbox at button click so what u can do now is billingaddress.addresstextbox1 will not work u have to define setter and getter methods and then imagine address1 is the property define in the user control class then instead of doing previous thing i can tell BillingAddress.address and this can be put directly so like this this thing works .why i cant use directly means they are protected members so i need to define the setters and getters .

5)In datagrid control i want to update rows based on one column what event i will use can u tell before and after events u were not remeberring that ?
sol) There are many events like row updated row deleted in which we can write the code for updating rows based on one column and further for reference u can refer the following videos 
In this refer mainly 8th video and if u want previous knowledge also means refer all the videos in the provided url okay .. G:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\two\TASP2W1_P2\VIDEO\L08 


Based on selection on row i will show pop up means in the table if instock colum is value is 0 i will prevent the user from accessing it .

GridviewSelectedIndexChanging( object sender ,e  ) 
{
int new_index=e.NewSelectedIndex ;
object productid=GridView1.DataKeys[new_index].value ;(This is the way to retrive the value of primary key to display it in message lebale) 
string productname= GridView1.Rows[new_index].Cells[0].Text;
string instock=GridView1.Rows[new_index].Cells[3].Text;
CheckBox discontinued= GridView1.Rows[new_index].Cells[6].controls[0] as checkbox ;

if(instock=="0")
{
e.cancel=true;
MessageLabel.Text=" dont select the value ";

}

else if (discontinued.checked)
{
e.cancel=true;
MessageLabel.Text=" dont select the value ";

}
 

}
Note : when u are working with slectedIndexchanged event then u have to direcly use selected. instead of rows[new_index] as u know it is selected earlier u were not knowing so used above coding .

Note : Itemtemplate and Edititemtemplate can be used graphically so from the available fields u choose one column of template field to selected columns of drop down list and then come out select smart tag and in that choose edit template highlight hyperlink and select the template column and u just want to display so when u select column u can 5 regions u can see go into itemtemplete drop a html table and 4 labels and select one of two labels and apply databindings to it with some column in table so this is all about itemtemplate graphically using and edititemtemplate is used when i am having a foriegn keys in the table i want to provide drop down for it so there again select the column of foreingn key convert it into template field and come out and slect edit templates from smart tag and select columns remove textbox already present in edititemtempl region and put drop down so that from that only i select so this all about templates etc .so for all this u have to go into advance and select insert,update and delete checkoption .okay      
 
6) use of virtual function ?

sol) when  u want the method of base class to be overriden by sub classes we make those methods as virtual .Generally if it is abstract we will defintely override it but same method with body both in base and subclass u can go for virtual keyword so u can give hime and example of abstract and override things well okay .

7) Inside a div tag some set of tags like anchor tags are there in jquery what u will do such that in that div tag only it should be updated and how can i call a second anchor or third anchor tag explain using jquery explain?
sol) when u become through in jquery u can refer from there still not that much perfect so u can leave it right now this .

8) what i can do to  div tag that it will be blurred when i click there or what u can do such that div tag should appear in top of every control  ?
sol) related to designing u can leave this for time being.

9) There is a hyperlink control in a datagrid so i want to call a function on click of hyperlink control how u will do that explain ?(binding method which u have used in bbyb check that okay  )

sol) For this also u can refer to same videos url as H:\Total_Training_Of_Asp.net\two\TASP2W1_P2\VIDEO\L08 and in this u can refer to templates video or u can check the code of bbyb as well as u have mentioned in the bracket so check that one it will be enough .

10) empid  year month and sal is there for an employee table and values are like this

    1  2012 jan 10000
	2  2012 feb 11000
	1  2013 jan 12000
	2  2013 feb 11000
	
	
	write a query to find total salary of emp in the years like id ,year should be there in the column okay ?
	
	sol) create a table like this first 
	create table empdata(empid int ,yeartaken varchar(30) ,monthtaken varchar(30) ,sal int)
    
	then insert values like this 
	
1	2000	jan	    2000
2	2001	march	4000
3	2004	april	3000
1	2005	jan	    4000
2	2007	march	4000
3	2006	april	9000
1	2009	jan	    7000
2	2010	march	5000
3	2011	april	4000
1	2012	jan	    2300
2	2013	march	4400
3	2014	april	3400
1	2000	jan	    4000
2	2001	march	6000
3	2004	april	3000
1	2005	jan	    2000
2	2007	march	4000
3	2006	april	6000
1	2009	jan	    8000
2	2010	march	3000
3	2011	april	9000
1	2012	jan	    2300
2	2013	march	4400
3	2014	april	3400
1	2000	jan	    4000
2	2001	march	6000
3	2004	april	3000
	
and finally fire the following commands to get the correct result 

select empid,sum(sal) from empdata group by empid
select yeartaken,sum(sal) from empdata group by yeartaken 
select empid,yeartaken ,sum(sal) from empdata group by empid,yeartaken


11)have u used rowcommand property something like that in  the data grid contorls?

2)can we change the port no of  web service ?
sol)yes u can change .
3)can we use app code class in the business layer ?
sol) yes u can use it no problem 
4)what is the use of stuff ?
sol) it is just like substring instead of extracting the value we add the values thats all it is .
5)what is the circular dependency ?
sol) Circular dependencies between classes are not necessarily harmful. Indeed, in some cases they are desirable. For example, if your application dealt with pets and their owners, you would expect the Pet class to have a method to get the pet's owner, and the Owner class to have a method that returns the list of pets. Sure, this can make memory management more difficult (in a non-GC'ed language). But if the circularity is inherent in the problem, then trying to get rid of it is probably going to lead to more problems.

On the other hand, circular dependencies between modules is harmful. It is generally indicative of a poorly thought-out module structure, and/or failure to stick to the original modularization. In general, a code-base with uncontrolled cross-dependencies will be harder to understand and harder to maintain than one with a clean, layered module structure. Without decent modules, it can be much harder to predict whether the effects of a change. And that makes maintenance harder, and leads to "code decay" resulting from ill-conceived patching.

    {

        Console.Write("enter a number ");
        int n;
        n = Convert.ToInt16(Console.ReadLine());
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)

            {
                Console.WriteLine("Factors of {0} is {1}", n, i);

            }

        }
        Console.ReadLine();

    }

}


2)write and describe all the asp.net validation controls ?
3) How will u navigate from one page to another using javascript ?
sol) <script language="javascript">
        function Login() {
            var User = document.getElementById('<%=Txtusername.ClientID%>').value;
            var Pass = document.getElementById('<%=TxtPassword.ClientID%>').value;
            if (User == "admin" && Pass == "admin") {
                window.location.href = 'Home.aspx';
 
              
            }
            else {
               
            }
        }
    </script>
	
	
4) To provide what u will use lock,synchronize etc some methods were given ?
5)There is table with emp(empid,empname,salary ,deptid) and another table dept(deptid,deptname)
U have to find out the employee with highest salary in dept or which dept is having highest salary something like that u have to fire a query in this okay ?

sol)select * from dept (already created in previous example ) 
create table empwithsal( empid int primary key ,empname varchar(30) ,
salary int,deptid int foreign key references dept(deptid) )

insert into empwithsal values (101,'mohan',2000,1001)
insert into empwithsal values (102,'kiran',1500,1002)
insert into empwithsal values (103,'madhu',2300,1003)
insert into empwithsal values (104,'raghu',3000,1001)
insert into empwithsal values (105,'priya',2400,1001)
insert into empwithsal values (106,'girish',2500,1002) 

select * from dept
select * from empwithsal;

Now i need to find out the answer for the above query which is like this 


select * from dept
select * from empwithsal;

select deptname ,max(salary) as maxsalinthatdept from dept join empwithsal on 
dept.deptid=empwithsal.deptid group by deptname 


so the above query tells us that in this deptartment the higesh salary is this but not revealing the name so i can try below query which will also not give accurate answer but near by 

select deptname ,empname ,max(salary) as maxsalinthatdept from dept join empwithsal on 
dept.deptid=empwithsal.deptid group by deptname ,empname


6)what is the difference between http handler and http module ?

_____________________________
1) Asked me to write a query involving self join involving managers count u want to know from the previous tables emp and dept based on those two tables only okay ?
sol) USE TempDb
GO
-- Create a Table
CREATE TABLE Employee(
EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name NVARCHAR(50),
ManagerID INT
)
GO
-- Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO Employee
SELECT 1, 'Mike', 3
UNION ALL
SELECT 2, 'David', 3
UNION ALL
SELECT 3, 'Roger', NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 4, 'Marry',2
UNION ALL
SELECT 5, 'Joseph',2
UNION ALL
SELECT 7, 'Ben',2
GO
-- Check the data
SELECT *
FROM Employee
GO

empid  Name         managerid 
__________________________________
1	   Mike	              3
2	   David	          3
3	   Roger	          NULL
4	   Marry	          2
5	   Joseph	          2
7	   Ben  	          2

Then i will fire this below query for getting the result okay 

select e1.Name as Employee_name ,e2.Name as Manager_name from Employee e1 join Employee e2 on e2.EmployeeID=e1.ManagerID 

Mike	Roger
David	Roger
Marry	David
Joseph	David
Ben	    David

now i want to do count for managers 

SELECT *
FROM Employee
GO

select e1.ManagerID as managerhavingempid,count(e1.ManagerID) as nooftimesmanager 
 from Employee e1 join Employee e2 on e2.EmployeeID=e1.ManagerID group by e1.ManagerID
 
to see the difference i need to fire both the queries at a time .

Now to find the TOP manager the query is like this 

SELECT e1.Name EmployeeName, ISNULL(e2.name, 'Top Manager') AS ManagerName
FROM Employee e1
LEFT JOIN Employee e2
ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID
GO

1) what is use of debug and release mode in .net explain ?
sol) http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/visualstudio/N799060712-Visual-Studio-Debug-VS-Release-mode.html

http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/forums/thread/155362/release-mode-debug-in-visual-studio.aspx

2)what is unique key ?
sol) A primary key is a special case of unique key. Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in combination. And itâ€™s unique, what the difference from the unique key is the primary key cannot be NULL, and primary keys must be defined by using another syntax. Depending on its design, a table may have arbitrarily many unique keys but at most one primary key.

http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/database-sql/differences-between-primary-and-foreign-keys/

3) what is the difference between xlink and xpointer ?
sol) There is one distinctive difference between the two XML languages, XLink and XPointer. Both provide a standard syntax for defining links within XML code. When your readers click on the link created by either language, they will open another object. However, XLink provides a hyperlink to an entire document and XPointer links to part of the document. XPointer allows you to connect to a section of a document by honing in on an id attribute identified within the target.

1)where is cache memeory sotred in ram or harddisk (written test question ) ?
sol) we will find out answers for this later i think it is generally in ram only 
2)where do we use refactor code in oops principle ?
sol) Refactoring is the process of improving your code after it has been written by changing the internal structure of the code without changing the external behavior of the code.
3)why sometime i declare string variables as private ?why ?(hint he told tell me difference between sting and stringbuilder class means he wanted to say that strings are immutable so i can declare them private in set and get methods he was saying )

4)two different version of dlls are there how i will choose the latest one ?explain the procedure u are not keeping in bin directory some method will be there ?
sol)G:\ASP.NET 3.5 FUNDAMENTALS\Deployement (refer first five videos u will undersantand what u can do is for this question the answer is in web .config file in the compile section change the version no thats all u have to do to use the latest version of assembly okay and public token key ,culture ,add assembly etc tags can be used here okay ) 

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/457647/Understanding-ASP-NET-Application-and-Page-Life-Cy (check this url for extra information thats all ) .

5)I want to include some set of controls in one page and some set of controls in another page how will i do that ?
6)How will i retrive values from server page by page basis ? I am not talking about table sample method from asp.net how u will retrive values of result on page by page basis ?
sol) I think he is talkng about state management techniques from server side as i got this answer only when i kept the question in google okay .

7) we say repeater control is fast how it is ?explain ?
sol) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10578313/what-is-advantage-of-repeater-control-over-grid-view-in-asp-net-c

If you need basic rendering for read only items then its better to use repeater and if you need events , pagination and editable controls then you should go for gridview. Simpler controls with less in built functionality are speedy. you can do implement all functionalities of grid view to repeater but you have to do it manually.

I come to know that gridview pattern is fixed in and , where as repeater can provide customized HTML mark up. If I am not wrong, we can also customize HTML mark up by adding template field and placing table with customized design.
http://www.aspdotnet-suresh.com/2012/01/repeater-control-example-in-aspnet.html

8)what is bubling in asp.net ?explain ?

sol) Server Controls like DataGrid,DataGridView , DataList etc have other controls inside them.Example an DataGridView can have an TextBox or an button inside it.These Child Controls can not raize events by themselves,but they pass the event to the parent control (DataGridView), which is passed to the page as “ItemCommand” event.This process is known as EventBubling .



9)write a query to find second largest salary of the employee?

sol) SELECT max(salary) FROM Employee WHERE salary < (SELECT max(salary) FROM Employee);

or u can use this statement as well below

SELECT max(salary) FROM Employee WHERE salary NOT IN (SELECT max(salary) FROM Employee);




10)can u make a subclass as an sealed one ?
sol) yes we can make the subclass as sealed one i tried and checked .


11) what are the advantages of gridviiew over datagrid control ?
sol)1 . In datagrid you have to do lots of task for sorting, paging. In gridview sorting, paging is much easier and you can do with only 2-3 line of coding.

2.DataGrid control doesn't take full advantage of data source components. GridView fully support data source components. 

3.DataGrid is the implementation of framework 1.1. It doesn't provide support for complex implementation such as image loading, combobox use in the datagrid control.DataGridView is the implementation of framework 2.0 onwards. It is the overcome of 1.1 drawback. 


12)can i use itemtemplate in repater control?
sol) yes u can use it it is meant for writing customized application code which ever is needed manually we can write it .

3) which is better and at what time we will use datareader and dataset classes etc ?
sol) already answered above okay ...check it once u start doing revision for this file .
4) what is difference application pool and app domain or something he asked app domain pool?
sol) http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Interviews/answer/5761/what-is-the-difference-between-appdomain-and-application-poo
http://www.dotnetspark.com/qa/1533-what-is-application-pool.aspx
5) without web.config file cann i execute the page ?yes or no ?
sol) yes Yes, we can run an asp.net application without the WEB.CONFIG file. It means that the default configuration will be loaded from MACHINE.CONFIG file.


Because all the configuration settings will be available under MACHINE.CONFIG file by default these settings will be applied to all asp.net applications. The MACHINE.CONFIG file will be automitacally loaded when .net framework is installed.
it is something like if we had not defined the web.config the application will take the settings from the machine.config.the machine.config settings are overide by the web.config if u define the web.config for each running appln 

We just override the machine configuration using web.config file and yes our application can run without web.config file and it will run without debugging.

extra ) what is the use ## as u were discussing something with him about temperory tables stuff ?
sol) This is nothing global temp tables so u want to see from different connections one table then u use this global table and it will untill it has atleast one global temp table.

6)what is the use of output clause ?
sol)G:\TOTAL.TRAINING.ONLINE.MICROSOFT.SQL.SERVER.DEVELOPMENT-HELL\Lesson 11 MODIFYING DATA   (29 min)
If u want to use inserted and deleted magic tables outside triggers u can go for output clause .Generally i see this using and generally at run time at that moment so u can use table variables and stored this output clause values in the transaction which is happening.
https://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/implementing-the-output-clause-in-sql-server-2008/ so this is some url u can follow for extra knowledge .

7) Tell me different modules which u have used in your project ? explain and draw the architecture for ur project as well ?
sol) It will be done later once i start analizing my projects okay .
8) Explain fully to me sdlc process ?
sol) G:\CBT Nuggets Microsoft Programming NET 4 Software Development Fundamentals 98-361(refer 10th and 11th videos okay ) 
and also refer some other videos for extra knowledge eventhough u know it well okay .
9) have u done testing what testing u have used in ur application ?

10) write down the architecture of ado.net ?

1)procedure to add dataset dynamically and how to use dynamically datagrid is it possible ?
sol)for dataset dynamic creation code is like this 

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        GridView1.DataSource = GetResults();
        GridView1.DataBind();
   }
private DataTable GetResults()
    {
       DataTable dt = new DataTable();
        dt.Columns.Add("Id", typeof(string));
        dt.Columns.Add("FirstName", typeof(string));
        dt.Columns.Add("LastName", typeof(string));
        dt.Columns.Add("Age", typeof(int));
        dt.Rows.Add("1", "S", "B", "2");
        return dt;
    }
	
	for dynamic datagrid creation code is like this :
	 <asp:Panel ID="PanelGridView" runat="server">

            </asp:Panel>
			source code is like this :
			_____________________________
			SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(sqlQueryString, YourConnection);
        DataSet ds = new DataSet();
        da.Fill(ds);        
        GridView GridView1 = new GridView();
        GridView1.DataSource = ds.Tables[0];
        GridView1.DataBind();
        PanelGridView.Controls.Add(GridView1);

2)what is xml serilization ?How do we do it ?
sol) http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2640/XML-Serialization-in-NET

  Below we can see some sample code present :
  
 public  class Person
{
   public Person( string firstName, string lastName )
   {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
   }

   public string firstName;
   public string lastName;
}   

static void Main()
{
   Person person = new Person( "John", "Doe" );

   XmlSerializer x = new XmlSerializer( typeof(Person) );
   TextWriter writer = new StreamWriter( "person.xml" );
   x.Serialize( writer, person );
}

The output which i will get is nothing but an xml file with data defined in the person class okay .

3)write steps to connecting to database stored procudure which takes some parameter but use data set not sqlcommand how u will do it tell me the steps for this ?

http://www.codeproject.com/Questions/500189/howplustopluspopulateplusaplusdropdownpluslistplus
sample code u can check out here 

public DataSet GetItems()
{
    SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("procedureName;", con);
    cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
    SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
    DataSet ds = new DataSet();
    try
    {
        con.Open();
        da.Fill(ds);
        con.Close();       
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        //write error message
    }  
     return ds; 
}

or u can use below code as well this also works well ..remember why i am using dataset instead of sql data reader is that this dataset can be binded to multiple bulledted list and i can traverse back also which is not possible in datareader class

public static Dataset GetProductsInCategory ( int categoryid   ) 
{
DataSet ds =new DataSet();
Sqlconnection cnn=new Connection ( "all the stuff which u know it  "  );
sqlcommand cmd=new sqlcommand("Select * from Products where CategoryID=@CategoryID",cnn) ;//stored procedure u have declared like that okay 
cmd.parameters.add("@CategoryID",SqlDBType.Int).Value=categoryid ;
cmd.CommandType=CommandType.Text;
sqlDataAdapter sq1=new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
sq1.Fill(ds,"products");
return ds;

HCL face to face round of Interview questions :
_______________________________________________

1)Imagine u have created a web service and u are accesing that web service through wcf and one of the method in web service is not showing in wcf side u cannot access then how will u debug it ?

sol) what error i am geting i will check that in google and try to find solutions for it generally the user might have forgetten to put any attribute or it depends on type of serlization he is using json or xml etc things are there so it depends completely upon the error okay .

2)How will u implement exceptional handling in asp.net dont u have exceptional handlers from entprise library which u are using ,and have u used ajax etc or how u will implement exceptional handling in ajax asp.net page ?

sol) http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/.net/net_asp/miscellaneous/article.php/c12385/Exception-Handling-Techniques-in-ASPNET.htm

There are three different error events in ASP.NET that can be used in conjunction with SEH(structured exceptional handling )  so that all exceptions are handled and the user is presented with a user-friendly error message.

    Page_Error: Occurs when an error occurs within the Web page. This event is in the Web form.
    Global_Error: Occurs when an error occurs within the application. This event is in the Gloabl.asax file.
    Application_Error: Occurs when an error occurs within the application. This event is in the Gloabl.asax file.

Methods in the Server object are used to handle the exception in the error events.

    GetLastError: Gets the last exception that occurred on the server.
    ClearError: Use this method to handle the exception and stop the error to trigger the subsequent error event or display the error to the user.

and finally u can go for custom error pages okay ..which u have already tried and if u have enterprise library some blokcs will be there which can be used .


     U have to download the videos from enterprise library and for this u have mentioed it in final ready file to download but not yet downloaded okay .

5)In Ionidea asked me to write stored proecures to retrive set of employees whoes slary is > 1000 but after wrting the stored procedure he told it gives exception that too many rows like that so how u will handle that exception then  he told use cursor get the value row by row like that and then asked something about trace do u know about it that trace .verbose etc questions yes i told like stack trace.warn etc i have used i told him 

and finally asked me to write an orridien class etc i had written for it that all.



Note : BasicHttpBinding is used along and compatible with  old web services and wshttbinding is used for ws* protocols so generally web services will have some web service enhancements for those this wshttpbinding is useful and net tcp binding is communication across processes and machines and netnamedpipebinding is for the communications on same machine and net peer bindings is for peer to peer communication.

 1)please explain MVC architecture ?
 
 sol) It is one kind of desing pattern in this view models and controllers will be there whenever a url is requested it calls the correspodning function inside a controller class and Inside that funnction we do coding we may write database code and inside a function we may invoke a model class and edm data context class and all and  add some collection intitlizer or object intitlizer and return the data and keep that in view and return it to the end user okay .we can return one objet or collection of object or view model object as well .

 2)what is the role of view engine ?
 
sol)view engine is help in rendering the data to the user by keeping that data into html tags .


 3)Please explain how the view is executing the code and what are the roles the view is handling ?
 
 sol)check slide 2 and slide 20 for this in app dev mvc slides so for the same slides i am writing the explanation below clearly 
 
 Anatomy of request is like this reuest comes from http and goes to controller and controller will call the model class and any modification in terms of persistent data happens means okay and model modified data is returned to controller and based on model modifed data corresponding template is selected means one view will be selected and returned back to end user okay .
 
 so every time when a user makes a request in MVC Application by clicking the link or a button then IIS ,asp.net and mvc framework combinely process the request so from browser to server the http request goes and iis sends it to server so IIS passes this request to routing engine so what request you have made this routing engine parses the request into parts like controller name ,method name and id to be passed inside a function .so this becomes the routing data to be filled and then controller factory or default controller factory uses routing data to institntiate the controller class specified by routing data so after wards controller comes into memory .This controller uses action invoker to seelct appropriate action method so how it slelected correct method is based on convention over configuration because inside flower baracket {controller}{action}{id} will be given so it selects appropertely and multiple overloads will be there but it seeprates the correct action method based on attributes as well and method should be public not static and return type should match etc things it will check and finaly select correct one okay .so after finding the method it executes the action method and select corresponding view which is finally returned to user in the form of html response okay .
 
 
 
 request (http)----->/ Routing engine /------------->/controller factory /------->/controller /----------->/action invoker/---->
 
                     /action method /----->/view / ----->response 
					 
	Note : In the controller function i will write the data base connectivity code which will return some object which i keep it in view and thrown to end user okay and in view what code i write on that object which got intitlized through by some collection intilizer code or object intitlizer code will be retrived and kept in some html tags and some links may be provided in view where to jump from there and where to go back etc okay .so in the function i will declare the object of model class intitlize it and then though them i pass it into the view okay .Based on what arguments i pass inside the function that corresponding data base code will be generated.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	


	
					 
					 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 4)How the view engine is executing or how the view engine is executing ?
 sol)same as above one they have just twisted and asked 

 5)what is the role of httprequest ?

 6)what is the use of iexecuted interface and iexecution interface where it is used in MVC ?

 7) what are the mvc return result sets ?
 
 sol) FileResult method used is File() and using this function u can return a file ,contentresult and function used is Content() and returns a raw text data to end user  ,jsonresult and function used is Json() and it is used for implementing some web api or to do some remote validation you can use it  ,emptyresult  it is not having any function but return nothing ,Java script result Javascript() function is used and it return and executes a script okay ,partial view result and function used PartialView() and return HTLM snippet okay ,Redirectresult and function used is Redirect() and it will redirect to some url which u specify inside it so check slide 32 in mvc app dev slides okay .

 8)what is the model binder ?
 sol) This is nothing but stringly type class which i am using as graphically creating view it asks for which class u want to bind it from models folder and all okay .

 9) what is lambda expression ?

 10)what is the role of http helpers classes in mvc ?
 
 sol) html.textboxfor ,html.dropdown for etc are html hephers only and html.actionmethod also can be used gnerally i can use hyperlinks in desinging part in marster pages okay but when my action method is returning a big collection and that collection if i click again i should jump to another page so for all those i cannot hard code the values using hyperlink then actionlink is best option based on routing values it will jump so when you have very less data to code and images you want to include and this thing is used in master pages then go for hyperlinks and if controller name is changing and huge collection it is returning which again need to act as hylink then go html helper like html.actionmethod okay .

 11) what is the route config file usage ?

 12) My web application in mvc i want to support five different url patterns how do u do that give me steps which you do it for this ?
     I want to call a list also in this url patteren means question is not clear what u do it parmater i will pass and that will give me list as return type so check once mobile for this question other hoven url patteren is enough for this code ?
solution : 

URL 	                             Controller 	Action 	Id
http://localhost/student/123 	StudentController 	Index 	123
http://localhost/student/index/123 	StudentController 	Index 	123
http://localhost/student?Id=123 	StudentController 	Index 	123 


so for above things the i had defined multiple routes to satisfy what i want okay ..

public class RouteConfig
{
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "Student",
            url: "students/{id}",
            defaults: new { controller = "Student", action = "Index"}
        );

        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "Default",
            url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
            defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
        );
    }
} 

so you need to define multiple routes to satisfy maximum url patterns that is only the solution which i have found from 
this url : http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/routing-in-mvc

 KPIT in Eco world :
 ------------------
 1)using linq give me 5th largest salary of the employee ?
 
 solution ) var highestfifth=(from p in employees order by salary descending select p).Take(5).FirstOrDefault; 
            or 
			var higheshfifth=employees.OrderByDescending(s=>s.salary).skip(4).FirstOrDefault();
			                or 
			var higheshfifth=employees.OrderByDescending(s=>s.salary).take(5).FirstOrDefault();
							
			so remeber take means from there it will take from first to upto 5 elements okay and skip means it will skip 4 elements and after that it takes like that it works okay .
			
2)what are the extension methods in MVC ?

sol) These are same extension methods in Linq only which will be used in MVC you should answer the question confidently ..refer your Linq pdfs for your understanding .

3)Explain me cleary the MVC Life cycle ?

sol)

4)Explain how you will develop the project uing poco classes explain me the flow that is enough write a daigram and show it some kind of algorithm you write it ?

sol)


5) Explain me cleary the difference betweeen viewdata and view bag and also write me in code and show it how it is used and all ?

sol)

6) In the database asp.net programming the database is having url of the images means i am not storing the images in databases but i am storing the url in database and now what i want to do is if i select check option that image should be visisble and if not that image should not be visible okay ?

sol)so generally a table is there with boolean and in grid view it will have check box as display now if i am implementing edit on gridview for the elements and if i check it the image present in the url should be uploaded so the question is now more clear so for this no implement the coding as it will improve your coding skills try to do it later okay after understanding the concepts from all corners with the video tutorials you have and refer internet also  okay .

so i am not asking you to do it in edit mode only if the column is having some check and some uncheck then for check the corresponding image should be uploaded .

so better is you write the code for both the situation you can go into selected index changing event of grid view and put one image and assign image.url to the path provided okay .so this is  i am telling for select operation not for edit and you can find lot of code in internet for this tasks okay also check asp.net projects book also how they are uploading the images and all okay .

But do it okay it will be nice okay .









7)what is collection intilizer and object intitlizer difference ?

sol)             class  Cat
                {

                    public int Age { get; set; }
                    public string Name { get; set; }
                }
				
	            Cat cat = new Cat { Age = 10, Name = "Fluffy" };---->object intilizer ;

                List<Cat> cats = new List<Cat>    ------>Collection Intilizer ;
                    {
                        new Cat(){ Name = "Sylvester", Age=8 },

Talent recruit india pvt limited (written test)
-----------------------------------------------
Two tables are there like this 

Family :

id   Name        Gender 
1    raghu        M
2    Gopi         M
3    Parvathi	  F
4    gautami      F
5    anand		  M
6    Gowri        M

Parent_Child :

child_Id    parent_id 
1              2
4              3
1              6
4              5


output :

child_id   child_name  father   mother 
1           raghu	   gopi		gowri

4           gautami    anand    parvathi


so like this above i want the output so include this with answer into your file and back up hard disk where join1 is there where u generally 
refer the things so in solving what u need to do is two tables of family create it with different instances and join with junction table and while applying on condition include and where clause telling genere M or F like that u try whether u will get result or not let us see later on this one okay but u need to solve and put this sample file as back up and also include this query in back up section of joins where u store okay 



2) two tables are there like this 

  T1 
  
  id    value 
  
  1      A
  2      B
  3      C 
  
  
  T2
  
  id     value 
  1        P
  2        Q
  3        R
  
  
  so now i want ouput like this swap the values like this into the tables as below means dont apply select and join just update into the corresponding table the values and all okay like this below 
  
  output :
  
  T2
  
  id    value 
  
  1      A
  2      B
  3      C 
  
  
  T1
  
  id     value 
  1        P
  2        Q
  3        R
  
  
  some three questions what is the output they have asked which were easy only these two queries were stuff okay .
